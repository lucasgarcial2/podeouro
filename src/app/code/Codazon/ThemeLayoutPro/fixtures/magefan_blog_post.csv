<p>On Nov. 3, &nbsp;Apple will roll out its seductive sports car of a phone: the all-new, totally redesigned, edgy, giant-screened&nbsp;<span class=""link""><a href=""#"">iPhone X</a></span>.</p>
<p>So why buy an iPhone 8 when that sexy iPhone X is just around the corner? The 8 is last year's design with this year's technology. It feels familiar. It's a safe pick. It's a ""let's not spend a thousand dollars on an iPhone"" iPhone. It's a ""Touch ID and a home button matter more to me than a leap of faith into the world of Face ID"" iPhone.</p>
<p><img src=""{{media url=""wysiwyg/codazon/Blog/tech-blog02.jpg""}}"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>Make no mistake: The iPhone 8 is essentially the ""iPhone 7S."" Apple saved the cool features and radical new design for the iPhone X, which costs 43 percent more -- $999, &pound;999 or AU$1,579 to start. And if you want the truly impressive dual camera, with portrait mode and 2x optical zoom -- both seriously nice step-ups -- you'll need to invest in the much larger&nbsp;<a href=""#"" data-annotation=""true"" data-component=""linkTracker"" data-link-tracker-options=""{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;inline-annotation|Apple iPhone 8 Plus|CNET_FAM_SERIES|402&quot;}"">iPhone 8 Plus</a><span>&nbsp;(<a class=""inlineAnnotation"" href=""#"">$981.00 at Amazon.com</a>)</span>, or wait for that eventual X. It's a different approach than Samsung, which made its whole line of&nbsp;<span class=""link""><a href=""#"">Galaxy S8</a></span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class=""link""><a href=""#"">Note 8</a></span>&nbsp;phones look new, but not too dissimilar from Google's take on the&nbsp;<span class=""link""><a href=""#"">Pixel 2 phones</a></span>. With the iPhone, new looks only come at the top end.</p>
<p>That X is tempting indeed, but my only real-world experience with the device is the brief time I spent with it at Apple's Sept. 12 launch event. Until I can eventually get one and put it through its paces, I strongly recommend that you refrain from buying any phone whatsoever.</p>
<p>But if you need a phone right now, or if you have no desire to pay the iPhone X premium, let's talk practical considerations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The iPhone 8's best feature is its processor, a fast new six-core A11 Bionic chip, similar to the processor in the iPhone X and 8 Plus. Thanks to an all-new image sensor, photo quality has improved in low light, as has video quality. The iPhone 8 adds an improved iPad-style True Tone screen, and the speakers sound nice and loud. All the new iPhones include wireless charging now, thanks to a glass back.</p>
<p>If you have an&nbsp;<span class=""link""><a href=""#"">iPhone 7</a></span>, you'll find the faster speed, better screen and better camera on the iPhone 8 ""nice to have,"" but short of ""must-buy"" territory -- unless you're particularly enamored with the wireless charging Android owners have enjoyed for years.</p>
<p>For anyone with an&nbsp;<a href=""#"" data-annotation=""true"" data-component=""linkTracker"" data-link-tracker-options=""{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;inline-annotation|Apple iPhone 6S|CNET_FAM_SERIES|606&quot;}"">iPhone 6S</a><span>&nbsp;(<a class=""inlineAnnotation"" href=""#"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" data-component=""leadsTracker"" data-leads-tracker-options=""{&quot;numNodes&quot;:3}"">$595.00 at Amazon.com</a>)</span>&nbsp;or previous model, however, the benefits of jumping to an iPhone 8 ramp up dramatically. The speed, screen, audio and camera improvements will feel significant, and you'll get nice upgrades you missed when you skipped the iPhone 7, including water resistance.</p>
<p>So, yeah: That iPhone X may look great in the showroom window. But ultimately, you're driving off the lot with the practical four-door crossover. It's more affordable. It gets perfectly decent gas mileage. But it still has the same nice high-end navigation package, entertainment system and fuel-injected engine as that sweet low-slung coupe. Not too shabby.</p>
<p>That's the iPhone 8. The baseline 2017 iPhone remains a top-tier smartphone -- a seriously good phone. Just don't expect it to turn heads.</p>

<p><img src=""{{media url=""wysiwyg/codazon/Blog/tech-blog02.jpg""}}"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>Make no mistake: The iPhone 8 is essentially the ""iPhone 7S."" Apple saved the cool features and radical new design for the iPhone X, which costs 43 percent more -- $999, &pound;999 or AU$1,579 to start. And if you want the truly impressive dual camera, with portrait mode and 2x optical zoom -- both seriously nice step-ups -- you'll need to invest in the much larger&nbsp;<a href=""#"" data-annotation=""true"" data-component=""linkTracker"" data-link-tracker-options=""{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;inline-annotation|Apple iPhone 8 Plus|CNET_FAM_SERIES|402&quot;}"">iPhone 8 Plus</a><span>&nbsp;(<a class=""inlineAnnotation"" href=""#"">$981.00 at Amazon.com</a>)</span>, or wait for that eventual X. It's a different approach than Samsung, which made its whole line of&nbsp;<span class=""link""><a href=""#"">Galaxy S8</a></span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class=""link""><a href=""#"">Note 8</a></span>&nbsp;phones look new, but not too dissimilar from Google's take on the&nbsp;<span class=""link""><a href=""#"">Pixel 2 phones</a></span>. With the iPhone, new looks only come at the top end.</p>
<p>That X is tempting indeed, but my only real-world experience with the device is the brief time I spent with it at Apple's Sept. 12 launch event. Until I can eventually get one and put it through its paces, I strongly recommend that you refrain from buying any phone whatsoever.</p>
<p>But if you need a phone right now, or if you have no desire to pay the iPhone X premium, let's talk practical considerations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The iPhone 8's best feature is its processor, a fast new six-core A11 Bionic chip, similar to the processor in the iPhone X and 8 Plus. Thanks to an all-new image sensor, photo quality has improved in low light, as has video quality. The iPhone 8 adds an improved iPad-style True Tone screen, and the speakers sound nice and loud. All the new iPhones include wireless charging now, thanks to a glass back.</p>
<p>If you have an&nbsp;<span class=""link""><a href=""#"">iPhone 7</a></span>, you'll find the faster speed, better screen and better camera on the iPhone 8 ""nice to have,"" but short of ""must-buy"" territory -- unless you're particularly enamored with the wireless charging Android owners have enjoyed for years.</p>
<p>For anyone with an&nbsp;<a href=""#"" data-annotation=""true"" data-component=""linkTracker"" data-link-tracker-options=""{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;inline-annotation|Apple iPhone 6S|CNET_FAM_SERIES|606&quot;}"">iPhone 6S</a><span>&nbsp;(<a class=""inlineAnnotation"" href=""#"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" data-component=""leadsTracker"" data-leads-tracker-options=""{&quot;numNodes&quot;:3}"">$595.00 at Amazon.com</a>)</span>&nbsp;or previous model, however, the benefits of jumping to an iPhone 8 ramp up dramatically. The speed, screen, audio and camera improvements will feel significant, and you'll get nice upgrades you missed when you skipped the iPhone 7, including water resistance.</p>
<p>So, yeah: That iPhone X may look great in the showroom window. But ultimately, you're driving off the lot with the practical four-door crossover. It's more affordable. It gets perfectly decent gas mileage. But it still has the same nice high-end navigation package, entertainment system and fuel-injected engine as that sweet low-slung coupe. Not too shabby.</p>
<p>That's the iPhone 8. The baseline 2017 iPhone remains a top-tier smartphone -- a seriously good phone. Just don't expect it to turn heads.</p>

The special feature of the shoe: The pattern of the BVG seat covers serves as a design element of the sneaker and makes it a collector&rsquo;s item. In addition, a BVG annual ticket is incorporated into the tongue of the limited edition model. If EQT Support 93 / Berlin is worn on foot, it will be valid as a ticket for all BVG vehicles from 16 January to 31 December 2018 inclusive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Berlin has a special significance for us. The city and its people have strongly influenced our brand. We would like to thank the passionate EQT fans for their loyalty and passion with this project. BVG loves Berlin and connects people to each other, which was the perfect starting point for this limited edition EQT 93/17, &ldquo;says Till Jagla, Senior Director at adidas Originals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How cool is that? Now we have an exclusive sneaker with our popular BVG seat pattern. We are sure that this shoe is a very special highlight for Berlin.

27," Occasional Table for Office",,,,occasional-chairs-for-business,,,,,,"<p>Occasional chairs can be used in a variety of business settings to make an environment more inviting, endearing, and comfortable. Offices, retail spaces, restaurants, and more industries can make use of modern occasional chairs. They can add a touch of modernity, accent colours, or simply be a practical place to sit.</p>
<p>sohoConcept designs and manufactures modern occasional chairs that can be used in these settings and more. Find out how an occasional chair can spruce up your business or draw attention to your d&eacute;cor.</p>
<h1>Office Guest Chairs and Reception Seating</h1>
<p>Occasional chairs can be used different ways in offices to make them more comfortable for both guests and employees.</p>
<p>Occasional guest chairs can be used in offices for job interviewees, clients, and other visitors to sit in an employee&rsquo;s office. These need to be welcoming and comfortable. sohoConcept&rsquo;s Harput Wood Lounge chair is a great example of an occasional chair that provides comfort while still looking professional.</p>
<p>Modern occasional chairs can also be used for reception seating in the lobby or entrance of your office. The Chelsea Sled chair is narrow and thin, meaning many can fit in a small waiting area comfortably.</p>
<p>For casual meeting areas, bright and big occasional chairs can be used. The Crescent 4 Star Lounge or Dervish Swivel High Back draw attention to themselves and in bright colours, can bring an element of fun and relaxation to a meeting area in an office. They&rsquo;re a great solution if you&rsquo;re looking for contemporary office chairs.</p>
<h1>Fitting Room Seating</h1>
<p>Retail stores can also make use of occasional chairs. Shop d&eacute;cors range from understated, to bright, to modern, to colourful. Occasional chairs by sohoConcept can complement and accommodate any stylistic theme in a retail shop.</p>
<p>Occasional chairs can be used anywhere in a shop. Decoration, accent pieces, for mannequins, or for displays &ndash; these are all great ways to incorporate them into your shop&rsquo;s design. They can also be used in fitting rooms in a variety of ways. They can be used in the changing rooms themselves to give your customers somewhere to sit or put clothes while they are trying things on. They can also be used outside the fitting rooms to give their friends and family somewhere to sit.</p>
<p>Because every retail shop is different, the style of modern occasional chair for fitting rooms will be different as well. sohoConcept offers a variety of colours and styles that will fit with any retail d&eacute;cor.</p>
<h1>Wholesale Restaurant Furniture</h1>
<p>While modern dining chairs are the dominant seating in restaurants, occasional chairs can contribute to the atmosphere as well. They can be used in waiting or lounge areas in the restaurant, takeout area, or bar to give customers more seating options. Regular dining chairs can be used here, but occasional chairs often provide a better, more comfortable feeling for your customers.</p>
<p>Another unique way to use modern occasional chairs in restaurants is as the heads of tables. Using regular dining chairs around a large table with just one occasional chair at the head is a great way to accent the d&eacute;cor and make each table a little bit different. sohoConcept&rsquo;s wholesale restaurant furniture, like the Rebecca Wire chair or Dervish Wood High Back chair, are as comfortable as dining chairs, but are larger and can make a statement as the head of the table.

31,"Panasonic Lumix DC-GX9 First Impressions Review",,,,497-panasonic-lumix-dc-gx9-first-impressions-review-and-sample-gallery,,,,,,"<p>The Panasonic Lumix DC-GX9 is a rangefinder-style Micro Four Thirds camera whose most recognizable feature is its tilting electronic viewfinder. The GX9 provides a healthy serving of new features and performance improvements over its predecessor, the GX8.</p>
<p>The most notable changes include the removal of the low-pass filter on the GX9's 20MP sensor, 5-axis in-body image stabilization (up from 4-axis), slightly faster burst shooting and Bluetooth connectivity. The shutter unit has also been redesigned, with Panasonic claiming a 90% reduction in 'shutter shock' compared to the GX8. There's also a built-in flash - something the GX8 lacked - as well as some tweaks to image processing.</p>
<p>Panasonic appears to have rearranged their lineup a bit, with the GX9 serving more as a midrange model than its predecessors, sitting alongside the DSLR-style DMC-G85. The price has come down to $999 with a kit lens, compared to $1199 for the GX8's body alone. Alongside the price drop, some features found on the GX8 are now gone, such as weather-sealing. The EVF is smaller and battery life has dropped by about 25%, as well.</p>
<p>The GX9's closest peers are the Fujifilm X-E3 and Sony's a6300, both of which have 24MP APS-C sensors, hybrid autofocus systems (which the GX9 lacks) and 4K video capture.</p>
<p><img src=""{{media url=""wysiwyg/codazon/Blog/blog-camera_02.jpg""}}"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>You can see that the differences between the GX9 and GX8 are a mixed bag. The GX9 loses the low-pass filter, get an extra axis (rotation) of image stabilization and adds Bluetooth and a flash. However, its viewfinder is smaller, body no longer weather-sealed and battery life has taken a turn for the worse. Speaking of viewfinders, Panasonic has gone back to a field sequential panel (a different technology than traditional LCD or OLED,) which some people may find distracting due to 'color tearing'. The LCD is now tilting versus fully articulating, which some people may find as an upgrade, and others will not.</p>
<p>The 20MP Live MOS sensor on the GX8 is as high resolution as you'll find on a Micro Four Thirds camera, though larger APS-C sensors perform a bit better at high sensitivities. Both the X-E3 and a6300 have hybrid (contrast + phase detect) autofocus systems, though Panasonic's DFD system has performed quite well despite lacking phase-detection. The GX8 has higher resolution LCDs and an EVF that's quite a bit bigger than the X-E3's. Both the X-E3 and a6300 have faster burst rates and 35% higher battery life.</p>","2018-03-29 00:33:31","2021-05-14 21:03:00","2018-03-28 17:00:00",1,1,,magefan_blog/blog-camera.jpg,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Panasonic Lumix DC-GX9 is a rangefinder-style Micro Four Thirds camera whose most recognizable feature is its tilting electronic viewfinder.

Critics spoke up quickly, pointing out that it felt like an empty gesture coming from a company that can afford to do much more.</p>
<p>The upside down arches were on my mind when I started reading that press release from Canon this morning, so it felt very reassuring to see the brand pledging real support behind an effort created by, and created for, women photographers. Sure, it's all marketing at the end of the day, and I truly hope Canon's support of Women Photograph doesn't begin and end with a one-time workshop. Issuing a press release is cheap. Following through, and staying committed in the long term isn't.</p>

So naturally, having a celebration devoted to appreciating them for all they do is a fantastic one, and what better way than to have a Galentine&rsquo;s Day celebration?</p>
<p>What is Galentine&rsquo;s Day? We&rsquo;re not even going to touch this one, when Leslie Knope (played by Amy Poehler) of Parks and Recreation fame sums it up perfectly:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only the best day of the year. Every February 13th, my lady friends and I leave our husbands and boyfriends at home, and we come and kick it breakfast-style. Ladies celebrating ladies. It&rsquo;s like Lilith Fair minus the angst&hellip;plus frittatas!</p>
<p>From that moment in 2010, a fictional holiday gave birth to a real-life tradition with an almost fanatic following, with women everywhere declaring that this needed to be a real thing. And why not? What could better than getting together with the women you love and admire to celebrate friendship and gratitude for each other in a fun and meaningful way, complete with (let&rsquo;s face it) two favorite food groups? Fizzy cocktails and whipped cream (not necessarily in that order).</p>
<p>So whether you&rsquo;re into brunchin&rsquo;, lunchin&rsquo;, or midnight munchin&rsquo;, we&rsquo;re hooking you up with some simple tips for paying homage to your squad on Feb 13th that will definitely deliver all the feels to the girls who run your world.</p>
<p>Your Galentine&rsquo;s Day party planning checklist</p>
<h3>Galentine's Day</h3>
<p>1. Invites &mdash;party&rsquo;s at your place! (Or restaurant, or wherever you and the gals like to hang).Grab some cards and announce to your she-ros that you&rsquo;re hosting a Galentine&rsquo;s Day gathering to celebrate female friendship!</p>
<p>2. Gifts for your guests. If you&rsquo;re thinking of handing out gifts to the gals, check out our gift guide for some fun and thoughtful ideas that will make them feel special. Galentine's Day</p>
<p>3. Favors that leave a lasting impression. You can scour Pinterest for hours for tons of fun ideas, but we love the idea of giving a feeling that will never fade. Head to your party supply store for heart-shaped balloons for each of your guests. Before filling with helium, write one thing you love about each guest on a paper heart and fold it up tight. Insert into your balloon (use a funnel and push through with erasure side of a pencil!), fill with helium, and add a ribbon. (Be sure to keep track of whose balloon is whose by using different colored balloons or attaching different colored ribbons. Not only will the balloons add to your d&eacute;cor, but guests can later pop their balloon at home to receive your meaningful message &ndash; priceless.</p>
<p>4. Get your groove on. Prep a music playlist about friends, or include songs that have stories behind them that you shared with various ladies in attendance. (You know you have them. Like the time you walked out of the bathroom at the diner with your skirt tucked into your underwear just as &ldquo;Girl on Fire&rdquo; came on the radio.) Galentine's Day</p>
<p>5. Bring on the bubbly. It&rsquo;s never too early for champagne (it&rsquo;s practically the new orange juice),so if you&rsquo;re kickin&rsquo; it brunch style, Mimosas are an easy way to go. If you want something red and berry-ish to suit the mood, try ros&eacute; sparkling wine and add raspberries or pomegranate. Another easy choice is orange vodka, cranberry juice, and club soda topped with orange slices. Plus, these can easily be made non-alcoholic by simply leaving out the alcohol. (But we didn&rsquo;t; just saying.)</p>
<p>6. A toast to friendship. (clink clink!) A few words to warm the heart always make for a meaningful moment. If you want to go straight for the jugular, you might try something like: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s around the table that friends understand best, the warmth of being together&rdquo; &ndash; Anonymous.</p>
<p>Or, go for fun: &ldquo;True friendship is when you walk into their house and your WiFi connects automatically&rdquo; &ndash; Author Unknown (internet probably). We can hook you up with even more ideas if you hop over to our What to Write page. These ideas work well as a toast in addition</p>
<p>to messages you can write in your cards. (Cue all the feels!)</p>
<p>Galentine's Day7. Cards for everyone! What would Galentine&rsquo;s Day be without a &ldquo;tine&rdquo; for every gal? (We just made that up. It&rsquo;s the fizzy drinks). Of course, you&rsquo;ll probably want to make sure each person in attendance is given a warm expression of how much they mean, and since you just saw our What to Write ideas, you&rsquo;re all set! Simply head here to pick your favorite cards. Or, you might want to give everyone a Thank You card for coming and, more importantly, for being the good friend you feel so lucky to have. Galentine's DayOur girlfriends are like our second family. These days, with the world spinning faster every second (so it seems), it&rsquo;s important to keep them close, and a little gratitude goes a long way in showing them how much they mean to us.

37,"It’s Healthier for You and Better for the Environment",,,,why-buy-local-food-it-s-healthier-for-you-and-better-for-the-environment,,,,,,"<p>Discover why it’s important to buy local food, the health benefits of eating locally grown produce, and why choosing local food benefits the environment.</p>
<p>Have you wondered why it’s important to buy local food?</p>
<p>Local food is now a mainstream trend, with more and more people seeking out fresh, local options for produce and other foods. And more restaurants are sourcing locally grown ingredients as well, often using the term farm-to-table.</p>
<p>But what is “local” food? How big of an impact does eating local food have on your health and the planet? And why is it important to know more about where your food comes from?</p>
<h1>What Is Local Food and Why Should You Care?</h1>
<p>There’s no formal definition of the term local food. But one common definition of “local” food is food grown within 100 miles of its point of sale or consumption.</p>
<p>But it’s up to you to decide what buying local food means to you. Maybe it means foods grown and produced in your state or your region. Or maybe it means that it comes from farmers you know and can talk to — for example, at a farmer’s market or through a CSA. And for some people, “local” is more about the values of small-scale and community-based than about a specific geographic configuration.</p>
<p>More and more people want to know where their food comes from and the farming practices of the farmers that grow and produce it. And this is important for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It helps you develop a connection with food.</li>
<li>You become more aware of what you’re putting in your body.</li>
<li>You vote every time you shop, and with knowledge comes the ability to support foods and growers you believe in.season doesn’t have far to travel before being sold.</li>
<li>Why Buy Local Food? For One Thing, It May Be Better for Your Health</li>
</ul>
<p>Local food can be better for your health for a few reasons. To begin with, local foods often retain more nutrients. Local produce is allowed to ripen naturally, while food that travels long distances is often picked before it’s ripe. And food picked fresh and in season doesn’t have far to travel before being sold.</p>
<p>Another study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry found that the levels of health-promoting anthocyanin pigments more than quadrupled as blackberries became fully ripe.</p>
<p>In addition, locally grown produce may be safer. When they are imported and out of season, fruits like tomatoes, bananas, and pears are often picked unripe. And then, they are artificially “ripened” with ethylene gas.</p>
<p>Also, foods from local growers may contain less (or no) pesticides. Farmers have to pay an extra fee to become certified organic. Some small-scale farmers use organic methods but aren’t certified because they simply aren’t big enough to be able to afford the certification fees. Even if they aren’t organic, small farmers tend to use fewer chemicals than large, industrialized farms.</p>
<p>If you can, talk to your farmers at your local market and ask them what (if any) pesticides they use. And be sure to wash your produce thoroughly to reduce your exposure to pesticides — which is especially important for pregnant women and children.</p>
<p>
<img src=""https://foodrevolution.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/blog-featured-buy_local-20171220-1400.jpg"" width=""1920"" height=""1022""></p>
<h1>Why Buy Local Food? It Can Be Better for the Environment.</h1>
<p>Food is one of the leading drivers of climate change</p>
<p>Eating more local food reduces CO2 emissions by reducing food miles — the distance food travels from farm to consumer. The average piece of produce in the U.S. travels 1,500 miles, while local food may only travel 100 miles (or less), according to researcher Rich Pirog at the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University.</p>
<p>Local food helps preserve green space. When local farmers are well compensated for their products, they are less likely to sell their land to developers. Likewise, with growing consumer demand, young farmers are increasingly likely to enter the marketplace by developing unused space, such as empty lots, into thriving urban gardens — many of which are grown organically.</p>
<p>Eating more local food can be one part of the solution. But, local is not the whole picture of food sustainability. The impact our food choices have on the environment includes many factors.</p>
<p>In some cases, food produced farther away may be more sustainable if it’s grown more responsibly, if it carries a smaller ecological footprint, or if it’s in season.</p>
<p>Choosing more plant-based foods is an important part of the equation as well. If you want to eat a more sustainable diet, look for foods that are local, organic, and low on the food chain. The higher the percentage of your protein intake that comes from plant foods, the more earth-friendly and healthful your diet will be.</p>
<h1>Other Reasons Why It’s Important to Buy Local Foods</h1>
<p>Health and sustainability are two excellent reasons to eat more local food. But they’re not the only reasons. Here are some surprising, and not-so-surprising, benefits:</p>
<p>Fresher food tastes better – When food is picked and eaten at the peak of freshness, it not only retains more nutrients, it also tastes better.<br>Small, local farms offer more variety. Our industrial agricultural system uses a monocrop system. But smaller, organic farmers may grow a variety of organic and heirloom produce, which you might not find at the supermarket.<br>Supporting local food aids your local economy. By choosing food produced locally, you’re supporting your community, and you help keep local producers in business.<br>Local food creates community and connection. In our increasingly online and isolated world, loneliness is a growing problem. Getting to know your local growers and shopping or volunteering at a local farmer’s market, co-op, or community supported agriculture (CSA) counteracts this trend. And doing so can help you build meaningful human connections.</p>

(And How To Get Enough Fiber!)",,,,why-is-fiber-good-for-you-and-how-to-get-enough-fiber,,,,,,"<h3><span style=""font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino;""><em>You&rsquo;ve heard fiber is important, but why is fiber good for you? And how can you get enough fiber? Discover all the health benefits of this essential nutrient, the best high fiber foods, and an easy way to challenge yourself to get more fiber in your daily diet.</em></span></h3>
<p>If you want to live a long, healthy life, fiber is a critical nutrient you need to be eating every day.</p>
<p>But fiber is often overlooked. And most people in developed countries aren&rsquo;t getting nearly enough of it.</p>
<p>Could your diet be lacking fiber? Probably so.</p>
<p>In fact, only 3% of Americans get the recommended amount of fiber. Most Americans get about 10-15 grams of fiber per day &mdash; a number that falls far short of the 40 grams per day recommended by leading experts.</p>
<p>So why is fiber good for you? It aids your body in absorbing nutrients from food and eliminating toxins. It fills you up and helps you maintain more consistent energy levels. And it&rsquo;s essential for healthy digestion, maintaining a healthy weight, preventing cancer and type 2 diabetes, and other proven health benefits.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>Is Fiber the Real &ldquo;Fountain of Youth&rdquo;?</h1>
<p>We hear a lot about the power of superfoods to extend our lives and keep us well. But it could be that fiber is better than all of them!</p>
<p>A meta-analysis published in the American Journal of Epidemiology suggests how powerful fiber consumption is to human health. Researchers analyzed 17 studies, including nearly a million participants, and found that every 10 grams of fiber consumed per day cut mortality risk by 10 percent.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>What Is Fiber, Exactly?</h1>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard that you need to eat more fiber. But what is fiber?</p>
<p>Fiber is found in the cell walls of plants, where it provides structure and functions as sort of as a skeleton. It&rsquo;s not digestible by humans, so it doesn&rsquo;t provide nutrients or calories. But it&rsquo;s critical to your health anyway.</p>
<p>There are two types of fiber: soluble and insoluble. Each performs a different job in your body.</p>
<p>Soluble fiber helps lower blood glucose levels and cholesterol, and is found in foods, such as oatmeal, beans, and legumes, as well as in some fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>Insoluble fiber acts like a broom, cleaning out your digestive tract, and is found in foods, such as whole grains, kidney beans, bran, and fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>Both soluble and insoluble fiber are found naturally in plant foods. Meat, dairy products, eggs, and oils do not contain any fiber. And processed foods made with sugar or white flour generally contain very little fiber because any natural fiber is lost or removed.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>Fiber is Necessary for Maintaining a Healthy Digestive System</h1>
<p>Fiber is known for its ability to keep you regular and reduce constipation, but it has other benefits for maintaining healthy digestion as well.</p>
<p>For example, diverticulitis &ndash; inflammation of the intestine &ndash; is one of the most common age-related digestive disorders in the modern world.</p>
<p>According to a study published in the Journal of Nutrition, consuming foods rich in insoluble fiber has been found to reduce the risk of diverticulitis by 40%!</p>
<p></p>
<h1>Fiber is Essential for Maintaining a Healthy Weight</h1>
<p>By increasing your fiber intake by only 14 grams per day, you can reduce your calorie intake by 10 percent, while increasing your sense of &ldquo;fullness&rdquo; and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Soluble fiber mixes with water in the gut to create a gel. This gel-like substance slows the absorption of sugars into the bloodstream while triggering stretch receptors in your stomach, telling you you&rsquo;ve had enough. So, you feel full and satisfied by eating the same volume of food, even when that food has fewer calories.</p>

<p></p>
<h1>Fiber Plays a Critical Role in Cancer Prevention</h1>
<p>Fiber is an essential part of your waste removal system &ndash; constantly eliminating carcinogens before they become a problem. For instance, fiber works to prevent colorectal cancer by improving intestinal transit time &ndash; literally sweeping away carcinogens.</p>
<p>In a study at the National Cancer Institute called the Polyp Prevention Trial (PPT), published in the Journal of Nutrition, participants were put on a high-fiber diet with an abundance of fruits and vegetables. Researchers focused on the recurrence of colorectal adenomas (polyps).</p>
<p>After adjusting for variables, it was found that the one food that made the most difference in whether or not participants had a recurrence of adenomas was the amount of beans they consumed. Many researchers believe this is because beans were the highest source of dietary fiber for most of the study participants.</p>
<p>But, fiber doesn&rsquo;t just reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. It also reduces the risk of other forms of cancer as well, including cancers of the breast, prostate, mouth, and throat.</p>
<p>Every 10 grams of fiber you eat is associated with a 10 percent reduced risk of colorectal cancer and a 5 percent fall in breast cancer risk, according to a study published in the Annals of Oncology.</p>
<p>Another study published in Pediatrics showed how women who consumed 28 grams per day of fiber had a 24 percent lower risk of developing breast cancer before menopause, compared with women who ate 14 grams per day.</p>
<p>The women who consumed the higher amount of dietary fiber also reduced their lifetime risk of developing breast cancer by 16 percent.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>Fiber Is Good for Heart Health</h1>
<p>Many cardiologists recommend eating oatmeal for breakfast. Their #1 reason? Oatmeal is full of soluble fiber.</p>
<p>Researchers don&rsquo;t yet fully understand the mechanisms behind fiber&rsquo;s LDL (&ldquo;bad&rdquo;) cholesterol-lowering power, but according to a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the soluble fiber from oats can decrease LDL cholesterol without affecting HDL (&ldquo;good&rdquo;) cholesterol.</p>
<p>In a review and meta-analysis of 22 different publications in the BMJ, greater dietary fiber was found to be associated with a lower risk of both cardiovascular disease and coronary artery disease.</p>
<p>High-fiber foods may also have other benefits for heart health, such as reducing blood pressure and inflammation.</p>

See why so many people are going vegan and eating plant-based &mdash; from athletes to celebrities to everyday people. The rise of plant-based diets is here to stay.</span></em></h3>
<h3><em><span style=""font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino;"">Diets that limit or exclude meat, dairy products, and eggs used to be on the fringe and were seen as fads. Identifying as vegetarian, vegan, or plant-based was often viewed as weird or extreme &mdash; more the domain of hippies and activists than of large numbers of everyday people.</span></em></h3>
<h3><em><span style=""font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino;"">Until recently, references to vegan eating in the mainstream media were often negative. And meat-free food options weren&rsquo;t universally available or appetizing. But now, all that is changing.</span></em></h3>
<p><em><span style=""font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino;""><br /></span></em></p>
<p></p>
<h1>Much of the world is trending towards plant-based eating &mdash; and this global shift could be here to stay.</h1>
<p>Millennials are central drivers of this worldwide shift away from consuming animal products. But the plant-based movement is bigger than any one generation. Everyone from celebrities to athletes to entire companies including Google and countries as big as China are supporting the movement to eat more plant-based foods.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Plant-based eating may not be entirely mainstream yet. But it&rsquo;s becoming more accepted every day. And this trend is having far-reaching impacts.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>Vegan Statistics: Incredible Signs the Global Demand for Plant-Based Foods Is Rising</h1>
<p>First of all, according to a forecast report by restaurant consultancy group Baum + Whiteman in New York, &ldquo;plant-based&rdquo; will be the food trend of 2018. The report also anticipates that plant-based foods will become the new organic.</p>
<p>In addition, Nestl&eacute;, the largest food company in the world, predicts that plant-based foods will continue to grow and &hellip; this trend is &ldquo;here to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another company, international delivery service Just Eat named veganism as a top consumer trend in 2018 &mdash; due to a 94% increase in &ldquo;healthy food ordered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And similarly, according to data released by GrubHub, the top takeaway marketplace in the U.S., orders for plant-based food have reached a new high. In particular, users chose vegan food 19% more in the first half of 2017 than in the first half of 2016.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Here&rsquo;s more compelling proof to prove the global demand for plant-based foods is increasing:</h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Search data from Google Trends shows an impressive worldwide increase in the interest in veganism from 2004 to 2018. Top regions include Israel, Australia, Canada, Austria, and New Zealand.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s been a 600% increase in people identifying as vegans in the U.S in the last three years. According to a report by research firm GlobalData, only 1% of U.S. consumers claimed to be vegan in 2014. And in 2017, that number rose to 6%.</li>
<li>In the UK, the number of people identifying as vegans has increased by 350%, compared to a decade ago, according to research commissioned by the Vegan Society in partnership with Vegan Life magazine.</li>
<li>Veganism was a top search trend in Canada in 2017. And the preliminary draft of Canada&rsquo;s new Food Guide, released in 2017 by the Canadian government, favors plant-based foods.</li>
<li>In Portugal, vegetarianism rose by 400% in the last decade. This is according to research carried out by Nielsen.</li>
<li>Plant-based diets are growing across Asia. New dietary guidelines released by the Chinese government encourage the nation&rsquo;s 1.3 billion people to reduce their meat consumption by 50%. Research predicts that China&rsquo;s vegan market will grow more than 17% between 2015 and 2020. And in Hong Kong, 22% of the population reports practicing some form of a plant-based diet.</li>
<li>In Australia, between 2014 and 2016, the number of food products launched carrying a vegan claim rose by 92%. And Australia is the third-fastest growing vegan market in the world.</li>
<li>Mainstream health organizations are recommending a plant-based diet. Including, among others: Kaiser Permanente, the largest healthcare organization in the U.S.; the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee; and the American Institute for Cancer Research.</li>
<li>Even Walmart, the world&rsquo;s largest retailer, is asking its suppliers to offer more plant-based products.</li>

<p></p>
<p>These are leading doctors, as well as visionary leaders and luminaries, who are actively working to improve our food system. Including names like:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Michael Greger, MD</li>

<p></p>
<h1>What Topics Will Be Covered During The Summit?</h1>
<p><br />A great thing about the Food Revolution Summit is that a variety of food and health topics will be discussed.</p>
<p>This is a comprehensive, informational event that will show you how food can help heal and prevent disease and save our world.</p>
<p>Do you care about&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Genetically modified foods (GMOs), pesticides, organic food, and food safety?</li>
<li>Preventing or beating Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other forms of dementia?</li>
<li>Reducing your risk or beating cancer?</li>
<li>The treatment of animals?</li>
<li>Clearing up food and nutrition confusion?</li>
<li>Or other important food issues, like heart disease, the truth about protein, and how your food choices shape the world?</li>
<li>This isn&rsquo;t information big food companies want you to know &mdash; they&rsquo;re making billions profiting from the status quo. Plus, this isn&rsquo;t information you&rsquo;re likely to get from your doctor, either.</li>
</ul>
<p>After all, nutrition basically isn&rsquo;t taught in medical school, and the medical industry makes trillions of dollars treating sick patients. There&rsquo;s no financial incentive to prescribe broccoli (although that&rsquo;s probably what doctors should be doing!).</p>
<p>But this critical information could save your life and the lives of people you love &mdash; while saving the planet, too.</p>","2018-04-12 04:06:00","2021-05-14 21:03:00","2018-04-11 17:00:00",1,1,,magefan_blog/blog-04.jpg,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,"Are you ready to learn how to take control of your health and heal the planet with food?

See why and get mouthwatering recipes for 10 purple vegetables.</span></em></h3>
<h3><em><span style=""font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino;"">The color purple often symbolizes royalty and magic. And lately, purple vegetables have been popping up in more places.</span></em></h3>
<h3><em><span style=""font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino;"">You might have seen shades of purple in your grocery store or local farmers market &mdash; from vibrant purple cauliflower to the darker skins of purple potatoes.</span></em></h3>
<h3><em><span style=""font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino;"">But are these colorful veggies really worth seeking out and including in your regular meals? Should you become passionate about naturally hued purple foods?</span></em></h3>
<p></p>
<h1>Let&rsquo;s Take A Look At Why Some Vegetables Are Purple</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Purple foods are nothing new. In fact, you&rsquo;ve likely been eating some purple vegetables since childhood.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And purple veggies have been around for a long time. Some vegetables are naturally purple, like eggplant.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And some are purple because farmers bred them to be colorful, like purple cauliflower. For thousands of years, humans have been tweaking the genetics of foods &mdash; naturally!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The process is called selective breeding. Unlike genetically modifying foods, it&rsquo;s a slower process. Farmers select and grow crops with desired traits over time.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>Should You Eat More Purple Vegetables?</h1>
<p>The deep purple color of fruits and veggies is usually a sign these foods have a good dose of antioxidants.</p>
<p>A particular type of antioxidant called anthocyanins gives plants (including flowers) their vivid violet colors. (They also give red foods, like tomatoes, and blue foods, like blueberries, their colors.)</p>
<p>Anthocyanins protect purple vegetables from sunlight damage, cold temperatures, and other stressors. And they attract pollinators, like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>They also can help protect and heal your cells from damage and protect you from many lifestyle diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular and neurological diseases.</p>
<p>For centuries, people have used anthocyanins in herbal medicines (from dried leaves, berries, roots, and seeds).</p>
<p>And mixtures and extracts with anthocyanins have been used for a wide range of health conditions. Including everything from hypertension and liver disorders to kidney stones and urinary tract infections &mdash; and the common cold.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>4 More Reasons to Eat More Purple Foods</h1>
<p>Anthocyanins have a wide range of health-promoting benefits.</p>
<p>Science is showing that they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anti-Inflammatory</strong> &mdash; Anthocyanins have consistently shown to reduce inflammation. Why is this important? Because chronic inflammation is one of the underlying causes of many diseases of our times. Including Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, asthma, heart disease, allergies, type 2 diabetes, arthritis and joint disease, depression, some types of cancer, and obesity.</li>
<li><strong>Heart Healthy</strong> &mdash; Consuming a high amount of anthocyanins has been shown by a 2012 study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition to improve many cardiovascular risk factors, including ability to lower artery stiffness and lower blood pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-Cancer</strong> &mdash; Anthocyanins are associated with cancer prevention. For example, a 2013 study published in Molecular Nutrition &amp; Food Research suggests that purple sweet potato may protect against colorectal cancer &mdash; the third most common cancer. And purple corn, though difficult to find, may have particularly potent cancer-fighting power. In research by Monica Giusti, PhD, purple corn showed significant blockage of colon cancer cells.</li>
<li><strong>Good for Your Brain</strong> &mdash; A 2003 study published in the Archives of Pharmacal Research showed the memory-enhancing effects of eating purple sweet potatoes. Other research points to the ability of anthocyanins to help prevent age-related decline in the nervous system. And anthocyanins are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and localize inside brain regions involved in learning and memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers haven&rsquo;t focused on anthocyanins as much as other flavonoids, so even more benefits could be found.</p>
<h1>6 Purple Vegetables and How to Eat Them</h1>
<p>Are you ready to play with more purple on your plate?</p>
<p>Even picky eaters might be tempted to try some of these colorful veggies.</p>
<h2>1. Purple Cabbage &mdash; Also Known As Red Cabbage</h2>
<p><br />You should be able to find purple cabbage fairly easily. And it&rsquo;s one of the best healthy food bargains because it has the highest level of antioxidants per dollar.</p>
<p>Purple cabbage is also a cruciferous vegetable, so it gives you all the excellent health benefits of the brassica family &mdash; including fighting cancer, relief from depression, and more.</p>
<p>The leaves are thicker than green cabbage, but the taste is similar. You can easily substitute purple cabbage for green cabbage in recipes. You can even use purple cabbage to make visually appealing cabbage rolls with your favorite filling.</p>
<p>Purple cabbage goes well in salads. Try this Loaded Veggie Chopped Salad from Veggie Inspired.</p>
<p>This beautiful chopped salad is a perfect way to eat the rainbow. Almost every color of the spectrum is represented, including a heap of beautiful purple cabbage.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid sweeteners, you can leave the maple syrup out of the dressing. Or for an alternative, you can replace it with a soaked date and puree the dressing rather than whisk it together.</p>
<p>Or try this Red Cabbage Salad from Responsible Eating and Living. The homemade prune butter is easy to prepare and makes this salad extra special and delicious.</p>
<p><img src=""{{media url=""wysiwyg/codazon/main-content-10/blog-05-1.jpg""}}"" alt="""" /></p>
<p></p>
<h2>2. Purple Onion &mdash; You&rsquo;ll Find Them Labeled As Red Onion</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Next to purple cabbage, this is probably the most affordable and easiest-to-find purple vegetable out there.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A 2017 study published in Food Research International found that the combination of quercetin and anthocyanin makes purple (also known as red) onions powerful cancer-fighters.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can use these onions in most recipes that call for sweet onion. The red onion may add color to your foods. For example, it will turn pickle brine hot pink.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Try this recipe for Easiest Quick Pickled Onions from What Great Grandma Ate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Make some pickled onions and keep them in your fridge &mdash; they might even become one of the healthy staple foods you keep on hand all the time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They add depth and flavor to many savory dishes. Add them to sandwiches in place of raw onions. Spoon them over chili. Or use them in your next Buddha bowl.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can also try this Fresh Pineapple Salsa from Veggies Save the Day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fruit salsas are a versatile condiment. And they&rsquo;re a great way to bring an abundance of flavor to any dish. You can scoop this pineapple salsa onto tacos, burgers, and salads.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>3. Purple Carrots &mdash; Now Available in More Stores and Markets</h2>
<p></p>
<p>You might be surprised to learn that carrots weren&rsquo;t always orange.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They were domesticated in the Afghanistan region about a thousand years ago, at which time they were purple and yellow. Orange carrots didn&rsquo;t arrive until the 1500s.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Purple carrots became available again because scientists discovered that purple carrots have special genes that orange carrots don&rsquo;t. These genes make them more resistant to diseases and pests.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Purple carrots, ranging from dark violet to reddish purple, can have an intensely sweet and sometimes peppery flavor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They are a beautiful addition to salads and veggie plates &mdash; they have bright orange, yellow, or white cores when you cut them. But you can also cook them and use them in a variety of recipes without having a big impact on the flavor.</p>

<p><img src=""{{media url=""wysiwyg/codazon/main-content-10/blog-05-2.jpg""}}"" alt="""" /></p>
<p></p>
<h2>4. Purple Cauliflower &mdash; Bright and Beautiful</h2>
<p></p>
<p>This purple vegetable is showing up on more and more store shelves, as consumer demand for purple foods has increased. (You might also see lime green and orange-colored cauliflower.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Purple cauliflower has 15% more antioxidants than the world famous antioxidant-superstar, kale.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Purple cauliflower retains its color after cooking, and it&rsquo;s said to have a milder flavor than white cauliflower, with a slightly sweeter, nuttier taste.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cut it up and add it to salads for a delicious crunch.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Try this recipe for Ginger Raw Slaw with Beet and Cauliflower from Trinity&rsquo;s Kitchen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This salad has an irresistible red wine color. You can even turn this slaw into a main dish by serving it over quinoa or your favorite whole grain.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you want to avoid sweeteners, you can leave out the raisins and the coconut nectar in the dressing. And be sure to choose organic or non-GMO versions of tamari or shoyu.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>5. Purple Kale &mdash; More Intense Flavor Than Green or Black Kale</h2>
<p></p>
<p>You may have seen purple kale, with its green leaves and purple stems. This veggie is grown for eating but also for ornamental purposes (many people find it stunningly beautiful).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Young, tender purple kale can be used in salads. And the more mature leaves are best when cooked (steaming works well).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Try this gorgeous Purple Kale and Pansy Salad from The View from Great Island.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When making this kale salad, be sure to remove the entire stem and spine from the leaves because they can be a little tough to chew. You can also massage the kale with the dressing with your hands to make it easier to chew.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you want, you can use another sweetener in place of the honey, or leave it out. And to make it oil-free, leave out the oil.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>6. Purple Asparagus &mdash; Sweeter And A Beautiful Violet Color</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The purple variety is less bitter and slighter sweeter than green asparagus. Enjoy it raw in salads (sprinkle with lemon juice or vinegar to boost the color) or cooked (though it loses most of its purple color when heated.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Try this Shaved Purple Asparagus Salad from Strength and Sunshine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Strips of purple asparagus are perfect alongside buckwheat noodles (which can be found gluten-free) in an Asian-inspired vinaigrette.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you want, you can replace the oil in the dressing with an extra teaspoon of the brown rice vinegar. Also, be sure to choose organic or non-GMO corn when shopping for this salad.</p>

49,"Patient-centric Technology Improves Quality of Care",,,,patient-centric-technology-improves-access-efficiency-and-quality-of-care,,,,,,"<h2>How Did We Get Here?</h2>
<p>The Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s primary objectives are to transform the current U.S. healthcare ecosystem into one that is:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>good for patients</span>, who can enjoy better health, share in their health decisions, and manage their expense effectively</li>
<li><span>good for the industry</span>, leading to overall cost-effective healthcare</li>
<li><span>good for physicians and other healthcare professionals</span>, enabling them to focus on delivery of optimal medical care</li>
<li><span>good for healthcare practices</span>, aligning practitioners, fostering collaboration, and working toward a single goal of delivery of optimal care</li>
</ol>
<p>If we were to rate the current progress of ACA, the healthcare sectors would have a lot going for them, but looking ahead, it may be a bumpy ride over the next few years with a lot more work required. As we benchmark the financial outlook for the first quarter of 2018, the positive indicators show healthcare companies&rsquo; balance sheets are strong, overall cost structures continue to improve, and stocks have good dividend yields. Continued demand appears to be on the rise for healthcare products and services, partly as a result of the growth of our aging population. Unfortunately, these positive factors are being countered by several negative indicators, including political volatility and uncertainty facing ACA and growing national deficit that could change some of the funding sources currently earmarked for the healthcare sector.</p>
<p>Prior to the implementation of ACA, it was well recognized by both the public and private sector that our healthcare system was not sustainable and we were on the road toward the &ldquo;perfect storm.&rdquo; The growing swell was influenced by 18% of GNP directly attributed to healthcare and expected to rise to 30% of GNP by 2050; care demand on the rise with over 25% of the population having multiple chronic disease and growth of chronic disease predicted to grow 1% per year until 2030; and consumer-centric care driving health and wellness to avoid higher out of pocket financial subsidies and chronic conditions. Even more alarming were statistics such as these:</p>
<ul>
<li>National average for readmissions to hospitals within 30 days following heart failure episodes: 20%</li>
<li>Patients&nbsp;65 and older cost over $26 billion annually</li>
<li>$17 billion spent annually on return hospital trips that wouldn&rsquo;t need to happen if patients received proper care the first time&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding to this trend is the fact that there will be a shortage of over 100,000 physicians by 2030.</p>
<h3>GAME ON</h3>
<p>Despite these mounting challenges, in today&rsquo;s healthcare system, providers are expected and incented to perform at a higher level. As a key healthcare supply chain stakeholder and the routine &ldquo;point of touch&rdquo; with the consumer, pharmacy also plays a critical role in patient engagement, stepping up and delivering long-term expected outcomes given the headwinds of continued pressures of lower reimbursement, more governmental oversight, and expanded scope of responsibilities relating to access and coverage, emphasizing quality and coordinated accountable care, and expanding emphasis on addressing chronic care conditions.</p>
<h2>Emerging Technology Connects with Consumers</h2>
<p>The key to achieving successful outcomes is developing a comprehensive consumer engagement strategy by optimizing bi-directional communication: When, where, and how you reach consumers matters. The key areas of opportunities include a platform for greater access, medication adherence,&nbsp;predictive analytics that would share insight from patient data for continuous and sustainable insight, and solutions that personalize management and optimize patient care.</p>
<p>By increasing the involvement of patients in their own healthcare, enabling them to manage their wallet spend and proactively avoid health problems and better manage their conditions, we create a changing&nbsp;<span>patient-centered technology ecosystem</span>. Emerging technology helps improve access, efficiency, and quality of care by putting the patient in the&nbsp;<em>center</em>&nbsp;of the digital experience to drive patient empowerment and engagement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on feedback from the pharmacy community, here several key enabling technology initiatives that are being successfully integrated into business models:</p>
<p><span>Data, Data, Data!&nbsp;</span><em>Including data analytics, artificial intelligence interoperability, and collaboration</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Intelligence and predictive analytics can drive patient behavior change</li>
<li>Data is located in a number of databases, and previously it has been cost-prohibitive and difficult to manage</li>
<li>With the power of technology, healthcare practitioners can begin collecting consolidated views of patients by connecting, cleansing, and joining all relevant data (clinical, insurance, demographics, and more regardless of systems or format) to improve the quality of care and outcomes, thus personalizing the consumer experience to drive the right treatment plan and behavior</li>
<li>Emerging application of artificial intelligence or machine learning for more uses can be a game changer for clinical decision support: The benefits of AI could potentially increase 20% productivity gains</li>
<li>AI-based enhanced EHR technology will aid clinicians, interpret data quickly, make medical and medication predictions, and help in decision making</li>
<li>Additionally, pharmacy is exploring the use of AI enabling removal of redundancy steps to provide for a more efficient and seamless workflow between healthcare providers</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><span>Growth of Telehealth&nbsp;</span><em>Greater access, medication adherence, quality of care</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Telehealth continues to grow in 2018 with the rise of new telehealth solutions</li>
<li>Telehealth creates better patient access, engagement, experience, and virtual house call by pharmacy and other healthcare services</li>
<li>Telehealth meets the consumer access demand by encouraging preventative care and medication adherence; offers a lower-cost, immediately accessible care option, especially in rural regions or for those who are time-pressed. It also enables the elderly and physically-challenged to obtain regular healthcare services without leaving their homes</li>
<li>Additionally, data collected in these services will enable better cost- efficient coordinated care</li>
<li>According to many pharmacy executives and other healthcare professionals, telehealth is a high priority, and 76% will offer consumer health services in this area</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><span>Smart Devices and Digital Medicine&nbsp;</span><em>Mobile platforms encourage better patient engagement resulting in better outcome</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Besides the growth of telehealth and telemedicine services, there are a number of mobile software initiatives encouraging better patient engagement resulting in better outcomes</li>
<li>We are seeing emerging smart technology integrated within commonly used medication/disease devices to improve patient engagement: Applications using Blue Tooth and /or Wi-Fi are becoming more prevalent to monitor, alert, and predict behavior and sharing patients&rsquo; information with their circle of friends, caregivers and family</li>
<li>Recently, digital medicine announced the debut of a ""<a href=""https://www.proteus.com/press-releases/otsuka-and-proteus-announce-the-first-us-fda-approval-of-a-digital-medicine-system-abilify-mycite/"">chip in a pill</a>,"" which provides the ability to monitor the physiology and behavior of patients receiving care&nbsp;for specific medical conditions, although there is a lot more evaluation needed on the impact of this technology</li>
</ul>
<p>As digital health technology continues to focus on patient empowerment and engagement, 2018 is likely to be a game-changer year for the healthcare sector, driving improved access and coverage and increased coordination and quality of care, ultimately leading to better management of the spend in our current healthcare system.</p>

But a&nbsp;<a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2661581"">study published in JAMA 2017</a>&nbsp;showed that, for patients presenting to the emergency department with acute extremity pain, there were no statistically significant nor clinically important differences in pain reduction at 2 hours after single treatment with ibuprofen and acetaminophen compared with three different opioid and acetaminophen combination analgesics.</p>
<p>Despite these findings, the study authors reiterated that opioid analgesics remain the first-line treatment for moderate-to-severe acute pain in emergency departments. Data from 2006-2010 confirm that opioids were prescribed for 18.7% of ED discharges.</p>
<p>The full study can be accessed at:&nbsp;<em>Chang AK, et al. &ldquo;Effect of a single dose of oral and non-opioid analgesics on acute extremity pain in the emergency department.&rdquo; JAMA 2017; 318(17):1661-1667.doi10.100/jama2017; 16190.</em></p>
<h2>Study Objectives</h2>
<p>A common, painful condition seen in emergency departments is extremity injuries. The condition is often treated with a single dose of an oral analgesic while awaiting further care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although there are many analgesic options available in emergency departments, there is very little evidence with which to guide clinical choice of medication.</p>
<p>The study objective was to compare the degree of pain reduction at 2 hours after ingestion of four oral combination analgesics. Three of these combinations contained an opioid, one was non-opioid, and all four were combined with acetaminophen.</p>
<h3>METHODS</h3>
<p>The study was conducted in two urban emergency departments at the Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY. Study authors were from Albany Medical College, Albany, NY, and Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Montefiore Medical Center.</p>
<p>This was a prospective study, in which a randomized clinical trial&nbsp;included 415 patients, aged between 21 to 64 years, with moderate-to-severe acute extremity pain and enrolled from July 2015 to August 2016.</p>
<p>Extremity pain was defined as pain originating to and including shoulder joint in the upper extremity and distal to and including the hip joint in the lower extremities.</p>
<p>The primary outcome examined was the difference in decline of pain 2 hours after taking the assigned drug per group. The degree of pain was assessed using a numerical rating scale in which 0 indicated no pain and 10, the worst possible pain. Subjects were asked to rate their pain intensity using the numerical scale before taking analgesics and then at 1 hour and 2 hours following ingestion.</p>
<p>The investigators assigned a predefined minimum importance difference of 1.3, stating that this difference on a numerical rating scale is considered to be a standard previously derived and independently validated, based on reports, to indicate statistical significance. They added that a difference of 1.3 is a commonly used criterion to define minimal clinically important difference in pain. Analysis of variance was used to test the overall between group difference at P = 0.05%.</p>
<p>For the assigned drugs, there were 104 participants for each of four combination analgesic groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group 1: 400 mg ibuprofen + 1000 mg acetaminophen</li>
<li>Group 2: 5 mg oxycodone + 325 mg acetaminophen</li>
<li>Group 3: 5 mg hydrocodone + 300 mg acetaminophen</li>
<li>Group 4: 30 mg codeine + 300 mg acetaminophen</li>
</ul>
<p>All drugs were formulated in opaque capsules so that they looked identical.</p>
<p>Subjects who required a rescue analgesic based on the discretion of the attending physician received an unblended 5 mg dose of oxycodone, which could be administered at any point during the 2-hour study period.</p>
<h3>RESULTS</h3>
<p>Out of 416 patients included in the study and randomized, 411 were selected for analysis. The sample included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Female: 48%</li>
<li>Latino: 60%</li>
<li>Black: 31%</li>
</ul>
<p>Baseline pain intensity was initially high (mean score 8.7 out of 10) and did not differ between medication groups.</p>
<p>Pain intensity declined over time in all groups. The magnitudes of decline were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group 1 (ibuprofen): pain decreased by 4.3 over 2 hours</li>
<li>Group 2 (oxycodone): pain decreased by 4.4 over 2 hours</li>
<li>Group 3 (hydrocodone): pain decreased by 3.5 over 2 hours</li>
<li>Group 4 (codeine): pain decreased by 3.9 over 2 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>The largest difference in decline in the NRS pain score from baseline to 2 hours was between the oxycodone and acetaminophen group and the hydrocodone and acetaminophen group (0.9), and that was less than the minimally important difference in NRS pain score of 1.3.</p>
<p>Seventy-three patients (17.8%) received rescue analgesics within the 2-hour period. The distribution of receipt of rescue analgesia was not statistically significant, nor was the amount received in morphine equivalent units any different across groups.</p>
<h2>Study Limitations and Conclusion</h2>
<p>The follow-up time was limited to only 2 hours. A longer follow-up would have provided additional information, but the study goal was to determine if a single dose of analgesic would provide superior pain relief for patients while in the emergency department.</p>
<p>Another limitation was that it was unknown whether the duration of analgesia differed among the analgesics, although the half-lives are similar and range between 3 and 4 hours. Yet another limitation was that adverse effect information was not collected. The degree of adverse effects could influence the analgesic selection, especially if one group had significantly more adverse effects than another group.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, this study showed that for patients presenting to the emergency department with acute extremity pain, there were no statistically significant or clinically important differences in pain reduction at 2 hours among single-dose treatment with ibuprofen and acetaminophen or with three different opioid and acetaminophen combination analgesics.</p>

51,"Why Aren’t PDMPs More Effective in Fighting Opioid Abuse?",,,,why-aren-t-pdmps-more-effective-in-fighting-opioid-abuse,,,,,,"<p>Long before the opioid epidemic was thought to be a public health emergency, prescription drug abuse and misuse were steadily increasing in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To combat this, states and hospitals have been building technological platforms to enable prescription drug monitoring programs that can the&nbsp;track habits of both prescribers and patients. But use of PDMPs varies by state, with some states mandating its use and others merely recommending that hospitals and medical groups opt-in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the Trump administration saying it will crack down on&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/directory/opioid"" target=""_blank"">opioid</a>&nbsp;abuse, it begs the question: Could these data-heavy platforms make a dent in the crisis?</p>
<h2>Every state but Missouri</h2>
<p>As it stands, every state has its own&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/directory/PDMP"" target=""_blank"">PDMP</a>, outside of Missouri -- the state has made multiple attempts and failures to implement a statewide platform. And 46 of U.S. states are part of the collaborative PMP InterConnect, an interstate group started by Appriss Health in 2011 that fosters prescription drug data sharing across state lines.</p>
<p>But whether PDMP use can truly impact the opioid crisis is yet to be determined. A 2017&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5477729/"" target=""_blank"">study</a>&nbsp;by University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and Northwestern researchers found PDMP use effects remain mixed.</p>
<p>On the one hand, researchers found an underlying link between PDMPs and a reduction of misuse and diversion. Further, many of the programs provide a detailed prescribing history of a patient over the course of the past three months.</p>
<p>While the use of&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/directory/PDMP"" target=""_blank"">PDMPs</a>&nbsp;obviously reduces the number of opioids prescribed within a state, the researchers pointed out a number of issues that PDMPs&nbsp;could impact. Namely, the &lsquo;chilling effect,&rsquo; which could deprive patients of necessary pain medications.</p>
<p>Further, even when&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/directory/opioid"" target=""_blank"">opioid</a>&nbsp;prescriptions were reduced, the researchers also found that it didn&rsquo;t reduce overdose mortality rates in states overall.</p>
<p>Another recent study by&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.pdmpassist.org/pdf/COE_documents/Add_to_TTAC/Briefing%20on%20PDMP%20Effectiveness%203rd%20revision.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Pew</a>&nbsp;Charitable Trusts outlines the obvious effects of PDMP use: identifying and reducing doctor shopping, controlled substance availability and prescribing, reduced medical and drug costs related to inappropriate prescribing, and improved health outcomes for some states.</p>
<p>But those benefits vary by state and are also hard to determine, as it&rsquo;s not possible to conduct a controlled study. And there are so many interventions going on in states right now, explained Cynthia Reilly, director of Pew Charitable Trusts Substance Use Prevention and Treatment Initiative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[PDMPs] have a benefit,&rdquo; said Reilly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen nationally that there&rsquo;s been a decrease of the prescribing of opioids and PDMPs are a contributor. There&rsquo;s also evidence that use of PDMPs can improve prescribing decisions and decrease the abuse of opioids, and to a lesser extent that shows it improves patient outcomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For example,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/how-michigan-kicked-its-pdmp-notch-clamp-down-doctors-overprescribing-opioids"" target=""_blank"">Michigan</a>&nbsp;is one of the states leading the PDMP charge. It implemented its PDMP in 2003, which was updated in recent years to address tech challenges, by transitioning to Appriss -- the platform used by most states.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a result of improving that software, we&rsquo;ve seen an increase in the utilization of PDMP and a drop in volume of prescriptions,&rdquo; said Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs Acting Deputy Director Kim Gaedeke.</p>
<p>Both prescribers and dispensers are utilizing the platform to address potential risks. And the state has seen prescription drug deaths level off, said Appriss Health President Rob Cohen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the tools that is certainly central in the fight against the opioid epidemic,&rdquo; said Gaedeke. &ldquo;But now we&rsquo;re looking to understand how do we continue to innovate and make it better?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Data challenges</h2>
<p>While some states have made good progress, it&rsquo;s not a nationwide trend. There is still a lot of work to be done, explained Reilly. Part of that is due to regulations that vary by state, such as how long that data can be stored, among others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In an ideal world we would want the information from a&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/directory/PDMP"" target=""_blank"">PDMP</a>&nbsp;right in a prescriber workflow,&rdquo; said Reilly.</p>
<p>To David Kilgo, director of systems implementation at Wolters Kluwer Clinical Effectiveness, that&rsquo;s the biggest challenge: the difficulty of integrating PDMP into the prescriber&rsquo;s workflow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In many instances, the prescriber must leave the screens in an EHR, log into the state website, search for the patient name, possibly making several selections due to the variation of names, and then return to the EHR to complete the work,&rdquo; said Kilgo.</p>
<p>Part of that is due to software models, which were built at different times, explained Reilly. Trying to integrate that data has been a massive undertaking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s partially due to &ldquo;the lack of a unique&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/chime-improved-data-sharing-patient-identifiers-needed-opioid-fight"" target=""_blank"">patient identifier</a>&nbsp;that can tie records across multiple pharmacies within a state,&rdquo; along with the &ldquo;lack of data availability across state boundaries,&rdquo; said Kilgo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine, for example, a clinician whose practice is near a state border,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Their state regulation may mandate validation of the prescription history of a patient, but only in the state where the clinician is based.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a result, the data received about a patient&rsquo;s &lsquo;in-state&rsquo; activity, may only be a small portion of the relevant patient activity, Kilgo explained. &ldquo;The very nature of a retrospective submission versus a real-time submission can cause a delay that reduces the effectiveness of the process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only that, but once in the PDMP system, the data often looks like a laundry list, explained Reilly. It makes it difficult to efficiently detect a prescribing issue or any overlapping data.</p>
<p>Adding to that issue is a lack of data standardization, explained Gaedeke. While most states are sharing data, it&rsquo;s not always efficient given the lack of standards around state processes and requirements.</p>
<p>Currently, Michigan is attempting to tackle this issue, by what Gaedeke hopes will be a standardized collection of data and the ability to make data available in real-time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the key is that PDMP administrators need to collectively identify what kind of standard to agree upon - so sharing data becomes more seamless,&rdquo; said Gaedeke. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re sharing today, but certainly we can improve on that process, especially if states agree on standards and protocols.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The way forward</h2>
<p><a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/directory/PDMP"" target=""_blank"">PDMPs</a>&nbsp;were initially instated to ensure appropriate prescribing and to avoid patients being given too many&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/directory/opioid"" target=""_blank"">opioids</a>. But it&rsquo;s time the platform improves to make better use of the data to improve patient outcomes.</p>
<p><b>&ldquo;</b>I think the evolution of PDMPs and continued evolution is going to increasingly impact the opioid epidemic,&rdquo; said Cohen.</p>
<p>The next step, perhaps, would be to leverage that data to address opioid deaths, enable treatment through PDMPs and pour more data into the platform to gain more insights, explained Cohen.</p>
<p>States are already making those efforts to determine next steps, including determining innovative solutions, utilizing data-driven analytics and &ldquo;to hopefully guide potential policy decisions,&rdquo; Reilly explained. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re also looking into whether we&rsquo;re really making a dent [in the crisis] and whether we&rsquo;re seeing providers using the data.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PDMPs would be more effective if the platform could actually better inform prescribers and identify patients at risk or those using dangerous combinations or high quantities of opioids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The point of a PDMP isn&rsquo;t just to turn them away,&rdquo; said Reilly. &ldquo;The point, in an ideal world, would be to have a dialogue with a patient. Maybe their pain isn&rsquo;t being properly managed, for example. We&rsquo;ve also seen that prescribers will use the information to talk to patients about substance use disorder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Too often PDMPs are looked at as a tool to impede access, but Reilly explained that those data and platform challenges stand in the way of prescribers having the time to make those crucial decisions.</p>
<p>To Gaedeke, machine learning and predictive analytics could be the key to making PDMP data more actionable. The tools could not just look at morbidity trends or frequency of patients receiving an opioid prescription, but to predict outcomes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goal would be to use those technologies to pull that data in so you can have better predictive modeling,&rdquo; said Gaedeke. &ldquo;The prescriber could see all of that data in terms of potential overdose death, and the like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As usage increases, it could hopefully alert the prescriber that there&rsquo;s something going on with a patient, said Gaedeke. And if the patient continues down that path and the provider doesn&rsquo;t intervene, it will lead to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more we can predict that, the more effective PDMPs will be,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the ultimate goal. The challenge becomes, how do you pull in all of the other data assets that could be helpful when trying to transform PDMPs to help us with the predictive modeling?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/directory/PDMP"" target=""_blank"">PDMPs</a>&nbsp;have &ldquo;such a wealth of information to inform prescribing, so how do we make sure more people are getting that information and using it?&rdquo; Reilly asked. That data can be helpful to determine hot spots of overprescribing and can help with more law enforcement engagements, along with helping patients get into treatment programs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough for states to mandate the use, as obviously &ldquo;if you require the use of PDMPs, prescribers are going to do it,&rdquo; said Reilly. The real questions are whether they&rsquo;re using it well and if not, how do regulators make that happen?</p>
<p>PDMP use is &ldquo;not just checking a box or jumping through hoops, it goes back to the idea of finding out what information is more informative to the prescriber and the best way to display it,&rdquo; said Reilly. &ldquo;And then, focus on getting it into the workflow and move toward e-prescribing.</p>
<p>Kilgo agreed that these improvements would be more helpful if more states adopted e-prescribing mandates.</p>
<p>For example, since New York adopted its e-prescribing mandate in 2016, the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/new-yorks-opioid-fight-pdmp-now-interoperable-25-states-dc"" target=""_blank"">state</a>&nbsp;has reduced doctor shopping incidents by more than 98 percent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From a fraud prevention perspective, speeding up the adoption of electronic prescribing of controlled substances across all states will minimize the opportunity for unscrupulous actors to falsify or forge documents,&rdquo; said Kilgo. &ldquo;It also creates a gate for opportunistic prescribers to pass through before establishing a practice that targets those seeking opioid products because of a substance use disorder.&rdquo;</p>","2018-05-23 02:46:54","2021-05-14 21:03:01","2018-05-23 00:00:00",1,1,,magefan_blog/blog-pharmacry-01.jpg,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><span>Every state outside of Missouri already has a PDMP in place, but issues with data standardization and differences in regulations inhibit their potential.</span></p>",,22,
52,"Drug Reimbursement Legislation Looks to Regulate PBMs",,,,drug-reimbursement-legislation-looks-to-regulate-pbms-end-pharmacist-gag-rules,,,,,,"<p>Pharmacists, how many times have you seen a patient pay for more their medication than they should, all because you&rsquo;re prohibited from telling them about ways to save money?</p>
<p>How often have you had to tell a patient that the cost for their chronic medication has gone up yet again? This probably happens multiple times a day, leaving you frustrated and reaching for your own antacid or pain reliever.</p>
<p>These situations are now being heard by legislators, who are introducing bills that will address some of the related activities behind these situations, including price increases by manufacturers and contract provisions that prevent pharmacists from sharing information about less expensive alternatives.</p>
<p>Many states are introducing legislation, often referred to as &ldquo;The No Gag Rule on Pharmacists Act&rdquo; that will prohibit health insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) from contractually preventing pharmacists from telling their customers about cheaper ways to buy prescription drugs. These bills generally have bipartisan support and would allow pharmacists to tell patients when their usual and customary (cash) price is less than the copay determined by the patient&rsquo;s insurer. This situation often arises when the prescription is for a generic drug but could also apply to therapeutic alternatives. Too many times, a less expensive alternative is available, yet patients don&rsquo;t know or aren&rsquo;t comfortable enough to ask their doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<h2>Current Pharmacy-PBM Relationship</h2>
<p>Pharmacies have been subject to DIR fees and claw backs when the difference between the actual cost and the copay is &ldquo;recouped&rdquo; by the pharmacy benefit manager. As an example, if the patient&rsquo;s copay is $25 and the pharmacy&rsquo;s cash price is $15, the PBM expects that the $25 would have been collected and will charge the pharmacy the $10 difference. Multiply that $10 by hundreds of patients and thousands of pharmacies, and it&rsquo;s easy to understand the motivation behind the contract language. What&rsquo;s the line from Jerry Maguire: &ldquo;Show me the money&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Pharmacies need to submit the claim to determine the PBM pricing. If the PBM then reverses the claim, not only does that take extra time and likely result in an additional transaction fee, the PBM loses the clinical data associated with that claim and can&rsquo;t accurately perform drug utilization review for the member in the future.</p>
<h2>Shining a Light on the Issues</h2>
<p>Fifteen states have either approved (CT, GA, ME, NC) or introduced (AZ, CA, FL, MN, MO, MS, NH, NY, PA, SC, VA, WA) legislation that would eliminate these practices. These states, and others, have introduced 80 bills this year that would impose regulations on PBMs. Included in these bills are language regarding transparency and new standards for PBM pharmacy reimbursement, customer charges, rebate revenue, and PBM limitations on pharmacist communication with customers about costs. More information can be found on the&nbsp;<a href=""https://nashp.org/state-legislative-action-on-pharmaceutical-prices/"">National Academy for State Health Policy website</a>.</p>
<p>Mainstream media is watching as well. Recent articles in the Detroit Free Press, New York Times, Salt Lake Tribune, and the Washington Examiner, among others, have all helped to educate the public about these issues.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/09/bill-clawbacks-gag-clauses/33692347/"">The Detroit Free Press article</a>&nbsp;cited a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association by researchers at the University of Southern California&rsquo;s Schaeffer Center for Health Policy &amp; Economics, which &ldquo;<em>suggested the practice goes beyond anecdotes or the allegations in consumer lawsuits.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The study, based on pharmacy claims data from 2013, found that customers had overpaid for their prescriptions nearly a quarter (23 percent) of the time, with an average overpayment of $7.69 on the transactions. The researchers found over-payments were more likely on claims for generic drugs, rather than brand-name drugs.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;&rsquo;Clearly, this is going on (at a) much higher frequency than most people imagine,&rsquo; Geoffrey Joyce, a co-author of the study, told Kaiser Health News. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re penalizing people for having insurance.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.ncpanet.org/newsroom/news-releases/2016/06/28/pharmacists-survey-prescription-drug-costs-skewed-by-fees-on-pharmacies-patients"">2016 survey</a>&nbsp;of 640 pharmacists by the National Community Pharmacists Association found that 59% of pharmacists had encountered &ldquo;gag clause&rdquo; restrictions at least 10 times in the previous month.</p>
<p>In addition to the legislative activity at the state level, there&rsquo;s also federal activity. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Susan Collins (R-ME) have introduced bills (with companion legislation in the House), that would bar gag clauses.&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s2554"">The Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act&nbsp;</a>would apply to plans offered through private employers or health exchanges, and the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s2553"">Know the Lowest Price Act</a>&nbsp;would&nbsp;apply to individuals covered by Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Insurance is intended to save consumers money,&rdquo; Sen. Collins said in a statement. &ldquo;Gag clauses in contracts that prohibit pharmacists from telling patients about the best prescription drug prices do the opposite.&rdquo;</p>

A woman who always knows what footwear to choose for every occasion, she's an expert in the field. Here, she tells us the six enduring shoe styles that everyone should have in their summer wardrobes.</p>
<h2>1. The kitten heel</h2>
<p>""I&rsquo;m wearing kitten heels a lot this summer. They&rsquo;re good in the city and work with so much &ndash; they&rsquo;re a great summer office solution. If you&rsquo;re not keen on flats, they give you a nice lift. They look very modern and that&rsquo;s something I think we&rsquo;ve gone full circle on. We&rsquo;ve seen so many stilettos, chunky heels and slippers that the kitten heel feels fresh. They&rsquo;re also really practical and look good with everything, whether cropped jeans or a dress.""</p>
<h2>2. The metallic block high heel</h2>
<p>""A metallic block heel like our Tony shoe goes with everything. Because of the shape of the heel, it&rsquo;s universal &ndash; you can wear it to different places. It&rsquo;s not a stiletto where trying to walk on a lawn or on a cobbled street is difficult. A gold or silver block heel is versatile in a way that block colours &ndash; a green for example &ndash; just aren't. You can wear it at night or during the day. Champagne-colour sandals work similarly &ndash; they have such longevity and versatility, which means that you don&rsquo;t have to pack so much on holiday.""</p>
<h2>3. The flat point</h2>
<p>""They go with everything. Summer shoes don&rsquo;t always have to be open. Sometimes with a simple sole, open-toe style you feel very exposed, especially in the city. I always wear chiffon dresses, so flat pointed-toe shoes &ndash; especially slip-ons &ndash; are a really good city option for me. The closed toe makes them slightly dressy, but because they&rsquo;re flat they still feel relatively casual.""</p>
<h2>4. The simple flat</h2>
<p>""We have a style with perspex straps, which makes it feel like you&rsquo;re almost not wearing anything. I like summer shoes where they disappear almost, so that you feel as if you&rsquo;re barefoot. Quality is so important with shoes because they&rsquo;ll last. I saw someone today wearing a pair of my shoes that were four years old, and that meant so much to me because it shows they&rsquo;ve endured. Don&rsquo;t invest in anything trend-focused or with tonnes of embellishment because you&rsquo;ll lose that longevity.""</p>
<h2>5. The mid-chunky heel</h2>
<p>""I would wear a mid-chunky heel like our Leticia version all day. It&rsquo;s such a good 24-hour shoe - good for the day but it also works for the evening. It&rsquo;s comfortable, because every shoe I wear and design has to be. They&rsquo;re also really good for summer weddings too where stilettos don&rsquo;t feel right. If you've a social occasion on a lawn, then the block heel also means you won&rsquo;t sink into the grass. Comfort is everything. Not only do I design shoes, but I also wear what I make. I'm also a stylist, so I lead a busy life which means for me it&rsquo;s very important that shoes are comfortable. I want my footwear to be functional.""</p>
<h2>6. The pool slide</h2>
<p>""I used to love styles that wrapped round your ankle or calf, but when you&rsquo;re on the beach it gets quite complicated. Everyone&rsquo;s gone swimming and you&rsquo;re still sat there unwrapping. Pool slides are great for the beach. They&rsquo;re so easy to slip on and off. I&rsquo;ve learnt my lesson &ndash; I&rsquo;ve gone to the beach in a block heel or a style with wrap ties and just find them a bit difficult.""</p>","2018-06-28 10:43:37","2021-06-24 17:55:06","2018-06-27 00:00:00",1,1,,magefan_blog/blog3.jpg,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,"Stylist-cum-shoe designer Tabitha Simmons has become a favourite among fashion circles, favoured for her feminine, glamorous shoes that feel as good as they look",,23,1

Today I'm sharing 7 ways to enhance your own natural beauty and embrace being a better version of yourself, including some of my own personal top tips that help me do just that. So if you're interested in a natural, fresh-faced look, keep on reading!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">C O M P L I M E N T R A T H E R T H A N C O N T R A S T</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Enhance what you have by choosing colours close to your natural hues. Take mental note of the colour your cheeks turn after a brisk walk and find a similar tone in your blush. I find rosy pinks in general that give a soft sheen are pretty universally flattering - I particularly love the Marc Jacobs Air Blush in Flesh &amp; Fantasy as it's so soft and blendable on the skin. Liquid blushes like Daniel Sandler's Watercolour blush, or cream formulas generally look incredibly natural too - my favourites are the Chanel Healthy Glow blush stick in 02 and Stila's Convertible Colour in Peony.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">T R E A T Y O U R H A I R</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Just a fresh trim can add such life to your locks, which in turn lifts your whole aesthetic. I like to go for a fairly blunt cut so that my ends look nice and weighty (or as much is possible for fine hair like mine!). For my hair, no amount of conditioning is too much, so I like to apply hair masks and treatments as often as possible. I've used the Macadamia Deep Repair Masque for years and it remains a firm favourite - even if only for the smell! A divine, sweet, fruity scent and it's slightly oily texture makes my hair feel delicious and soft. I can't wait to get my hands on the Edward Bess Hair Hero too - it's supposed to make your hair smooth, strong and glossy, and if it helps me get anywhere close to his locks then I'm in.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">E A T V I T A M I N - R I C H F O O D S</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We all know that beauty starts from within so I won't linger too long. Eat lots of colourful fruit and veg, leafy greens, healthy fats, drink lots of water and don't go cutting out major food groups - a balanced, nutrient-dense diet is failsafe. I do love a good dessert though, and my Healthy Raspberry &amp; Rose Cupcakes are a great way to satisfy your sweet tooth whilst getting your fibre and healthy fats - so tasty.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">A S E A M L E S S B A S E</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I think base is my favourite part of makeup and I think I've become pretty good at getting things looking light, natural and seamless through all the practice! In my mind, achieving this is down to both product and application in equal parts. My favourite foundations are the Hera UV Mist (I love this one), the Etude House Real Powder cushion, Charlotte Tilbury Magic Foundation, and my new love, the Hourglass Vanish stick foundation - I think a velvet finish looks most skin-like and undetectable. I only apply foundation sparingly where I need it - across the tops of my cheeks, my chin and a little between my brows and nose just to even out redness - and blend thoroughly with an airpuff, it's absolutely the best way to apply for me.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">My top tip for natural skin is to apply just enough foundation so that you'd be happy to go out if you were to stop there - if my face looks flat, mask-like, or it looks like I desperately need blush, lip or eye makeup to bring the look together then I've gone too far.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">L O W K E Y M A K E U P</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Yes less is more but enhancing natural beauty doesn't mean no makeup altogether. Rather than do liner, try tightlining your upper waterline with a dark gel liner - my hands down favourite is the Barry M Bold Waterproof liner - it's smudge and waterproof and deep inky black. I like to take a little more on a flat brush and wiggle it into my lashline, just to add the definition I want and make my lashes look a bit thicker - they need all the help they can get!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">For lips, I love a soft Bobbi Brown neutral like Italian Rose, but have grativated to oils lately - they feel so great on the lips too. Something like the YSL Volupte Tint In Oil or Clarins Lip Comfort Oil are perfect picks. Rather than sitting on the lips, they sink in for that pillow-lip plumpness I love.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">T R Y C R E A M Y T E X T U R E S</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I just cannot resist a subtle cream highlight. Something with super fine shimmer and a voluminous texture that picks up the light when you turn your head - divine. Kevyn Aucoin's Candlelight cream has been a long time favourite, it's definitely one of the best. Two newer additions, that have quickly become firm favourites for me, are the Burberry Nude Radiance and Rosie For Autograph's cream highlight, which features in her gorgeous palette - reviewed here.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">A top trick that I love to do is to apply some of the REN Beauty Shot along my cheekbones instead of highlighter - it's plump and slightly glossy and is the most beautiful, natural highlight ever.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">D O O N E T H I N G F O R Y O U R S E L F E V E R Y D A Y</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Inner confidence and happiness shows on the outside, fact, so feeding your ego with positive affirmations can do wonders. Treat yourself to little pleasures every single day - cook yourself a nutritious and tasty breakfast, or read some inspiring quotes, run a bath, write down something that made you happy, do something crafty, give yourself a manicure, or bake yourself a cake and splurge on frivolous cake decorations. Whatever it is, make sure to treat your soul everyday with something little, and you'll soon see and feel the benefits.</p>","2018-06-28 11:09:33","2021-06-24 17:54:14","2018-07-05 00:00:00",1,1,,magefan_blog/blog4.jpg,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><span>Whilst I love experimenting with makeup, playing with colour and trying out a new or different style, this blog's very namesake is the style of makeup I love most</span></p>",,23,

The quite often premium prices are largely justified by the&nbsp;</span><i>exquisite</i><span>&nbsp;formulas, housed in equally exquisite packaging - a lot of the time complete with little luxurious touches. I've acquired quite a few of their products during 2016, so today I'm sharing my favourite pieces from my collection - calling all beauty lovers for this one!</span></p>
<p><img src=""{{media url=""wysiwyg/codazon/Blog/supermarket-blog-02_1.jpg""}}"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>If you've been a long time reader here, you'll know my 'the struggle is real' situation with mascaras, and how, whilst I've tried countless, it's only the Chanel Inimitable Waterproof that's made the cut - for seven odd years. Without exaggeration, no other mascara holds a curl on my stubborn Asian lashes and lasts all day without flaking or smudging - until this sweet, precious little gift from Burberry entered my life. Every element of this mascara is something to shout about, from the gorgeous, signature Burberry packaging to the beautiful, hourglass shaped brush that fans out every last lash, to the formula that really performs. I really can't say enough about this mascara, you absolutely must give it a try!</p>
<p><img src=""{{media url=""wysiwyg/codazon/Blog/supermarket-blog-02_2.png""}}"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>I like these kinds of posts where I get to gush profusely about products, although it's hard not to keep repeating the same superlatives! The Nude Radiance fluid is the most gorgeous, versatile fluid that can be used alone, as a primer, as a highlighter or mixed into foundation. It's texture is so smooth and silky, and the particles of shimmer so small and ethereal, it looks incredibly beautiful on the skin and you can wear it all over without looking shimmery. A really good alternative to the By Terry Impearlious Elixir De Perle. There's also a warmer, darker shade, Golden Radiance, for those with a darker skin tone.</p>
<p><img src=""{{media url=""wysiwyg/codazon/Blog/supermarket-blog-02_3.png""}}"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>I can't think of a single thing not to love about the Burberry blushes. The packaging is beautifully weighty, with sleek lines and a magnetic closure - really simple and luxurious. Embossed with the classic Burberry tartan, the blushes may seem powdery and dry but apply beautifully to the skin, blending seamlessly whilst offering buildable pigment. Cameo and Earthy (see me wearing the latter on my Insta) are my two favourite shades, the former a mauve-toned, rosy pink, the latter a soft, taupe-pink that looks impeccable used almost like a contour powder.</p>
<p><img src=""{{media url=""wysiwyg/codazon/Blog/supermarket-blog-02_4.png""}}"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>This is a great one to have in the arsenal when your skin is feeling distinctly dull and lacklustre. Giving all the youth, glow and healthiness you could want, it's probably the most radiant tinted moisturiser style base I own, and without any sign of shimmer. On a good skin day, I like to wear this alone, but it's equally suited to wear as a primer underneath another foundation. Shade 02 Medium, the middle of three shades, is a great match for an NC ~20 skin.</p>
<p><img src=""{{media url=""wysiwyg/codazon/Blog/supermarket-blog-02_5.png""}}"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>I love love love my Dior loose powder, and I've quite perfected my application methods with it for a flawless finish, but loose powders aren't the most travel-friendly of items to be throwing into your handbag. Burberry's Sheer Luminous pressed powder is creamy, soft and silky smooth, and perfect for touch ups. I like to use a velour puff to press it on just where I need it, before spraying over a little of my Real Radiance mist to mesh everything together - and good as new</p>
<p><img src=""{{media url=""wysiwyg/codazon/Blog/supermarket-blog-02_6.png""}}"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>Whilst I know you can pick up countless tinted balms, at all price points, there are several reasons to add this one to your collection. A neat little tube means perfect for travel, the ceramic tip applicator feels so lovely and cooling on the lips and the formula is light, hydrating and delicately tinted - somewhere in between a balm and a gloss, they're actually very moisturising. All five shades are perfectly pretty, although Soft Peach (which applies near clear) is my favourite - my go to lip product for everyday.</p>
<p><img src=""{{media url=""wysiwyg/codazon/Blog/supermarket-blog-02_7.png""}}"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>I really haven't heard too many people talk about this foundation. Supposedly more matte than their more popular Fresh Glow foundation, the Cashmere is designed for everyday wear with it's long wear, apparently waterproof formula and SPF 20. Although Burberry claim it's light-as-air feel, I was pretty dubious prior to trying it, that a matte, long wear formula could really be as light as I wanted. But it really comes through on it's promise. The foundation is a lot more fluid and slippery than I was expecting, making blending a doddle, and I'm genuinely surprised at how well this stuff lasts. On my normal-combo skin, I don't need to powder at all and it'll last me the entire day without breaking up or moving around on my face. My only qualm is the shade range - not every step up/down in shade has a cool/warm undertone so finding the perfect shade for my personal skin tone was a bit tricky. If you're lucky enough to find a spot on colour match though, you're really quids in.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that I've left out some cult favourites (Pale Barley and the English Rose lippie for example) - purely because I've only played with samples, and I tend to personally favour face products a little better, but the eye and lip items are big favourites with other beauty lovers and for good reason - I may well post a v2.0 of this post at a later date including some!</p>

<p>Hi Peaches!</p>
<p>I can't believe it's been one year since we launched our <a href=""https://www.peachandlily.com/products/glass-skin-refining-serum"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Glass Skin Refining Serum</a>. My biggest hope when developing this serum was to create a toxin-free, high-performance, delightful product that would make it easy for all of you to achieve your best skin yet. Essentially, that means skin that appears so poreless, luminous, and translucent, it looks like a crystal-clear pane of glass — hence, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KrwUdBD9DY&amp;feature=youtu.be"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">glass skin</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last year, we've heard from so many of you saying, “Oh my gosh, I have glass skin now!"" We love hearing your stories because everything we do here at Peach &amp; Lily is for you. You're the most important people in the room, and we're always thinking about all the ways we can better help meet your skin needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s why it’s the most rewarding thing for us when you show us your love and support. Over the past year, you’ve been pouring out your love for our Glass Skin Refining Serum, sending us DMs and e-mails and leaving enthusiastic reviews on our site. Every single comment has truly brought a smile to our face; it’s been so humbling to be able to see your skin transform into what looks like glass skin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what better way to celebrate a year filled with love than by giving love back?&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you may know, for the last four years, we’ve been partnering with <a href=""https://restorenyc.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Restore NYC </a>to contribute to their cause: rescuing and restoring sex-trafficked women right here in NYC. We've had the privilege to meet some of these women, and their stories of resilience and restoration are inspiring and humbling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to build a more beautiful community by making a difference where we can. Today, we’d like to invite each of you to do good while looking good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To wish Glass Skin a happy first birthday, we will be donating $50,000 of net proceeds of the Glass Skin Serum!&nbsp;That means we’ll be donating 100% of all proceeds from the Glass Skin Serum until we reach $50,000!</p>
<p>Help us spread the word — not only will your friends love the <a href=""https://www.peachandlily.com/products/glass-skin-refining-serum"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Glass Skin Serum</a>, but they can also know that they are making a profound difference in the lives of so many women.&nbsp;</p>

59,"The 30-Day Glass Skin Challenge: Real People, Real Results",,,,the-30-day-glass-skin-challenge:-real-people-real-results,,,,,,"
<p>Hi Peach Fam! We’re so excited to share the results of our 30-Day Challenge with our Glass Skin Refining Serum! These results truly speak for themselves.</p>
<p>First, a little background: in May, we invited a diverse group of people with different skin tones and skin types to take part in our 30-Day Challenge—use our <a href=""https://www.peachandlily.com/products/glass-skin-refining-serum"">Glass Skin Refining Serum</a> every day for 30 days. We wanted to get truly honest opinions and an&nbsp;unbiased look at how the Glass Skin Refining Serum works to help transform skin.</p>
<p>None of the participants of our study had used our Glass Skin Refining Serum before. Many hadn’t even heard of Peach &amp; Lily before. No one was paid, though&nbsp;everyone received a free Glass Skin Refining Serum to use during the 30 days.</p>
<p>All our participants followed the same rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the Glass Skin Refining Serum every day, morning and evening, for 30 days.</li>
<li>Apply the Glass Skin Refining Serum as the first step of your routine, right after cleansing*.</li>
<li>Take a photograph with no filters and no fancy lighting. Try to take all photos in the same place at the same time.</li>
<li>Follow the Glass Skin Refining Serum with the rest of your routine.</li>
<li>Write down a few notes and observations.</li>
</ol>
<p>* Typically, you would apply the Glass Skin Refining Serum <em>after</em> your toner and essence, but, for the purposes of our study, we asked our participants to apply right after cleansing. We didn’t want the results to be affected by the different toners/essences people used.</p>
<p>We’re excited to share these results with you! All the photos were self-taken by the participants, and <strong>nothing has been Photoshopped or edited.</strong> Here are their results after one day, one week, two weeks, three weeks, and one month of use!</p>
<h3><strong>First Day Of Use</strong></h3>
<p>EVE says, “Keeps my skin hydrated more than ever before and think it is probably the best serum I've ever used!” Also, see how her skin looks more balanced and less oily and her skin appears more poreless, even after one use!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ANNIE says, “I was surprised how long it lasted! [...] the serum really hydrated my problem areas.” Even one use reduced the visible redness on her cheeks. She loved the Glass Skin Refining Serum so much, telling us, ""Love the product and now a die-hard fan,"" and bought our whole line!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The first time I put on the Glass Skin Serum, it felt very nice and hydrating like my skin was, as they say, getting a drink of water,” says STEPHANIE. Her eye area, particularly, looked brighter, her skin, overall, more hydrated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, people found the Glass Skin Serum to be lightweight and fast-absorbing, leaving no residue behind. Most&nbsp;noted the lack of scent and clean texture, and many shared that Glass Skin left their skin feeling softer than before, even with just one day’s use.</p>
<h3><strong>After One Week</strong></h3>
<p>JENNIFER says, ""[The Glass Skin Refining Serum] feels really nice on my skin."" Her texture also looked smoother, and her hyperpigmentation, especially around her chin, started to look lighter after one week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""The serum is good for hydration,"" says ZINA. Her fine lines appeared less visible as her skin, overall, looked more plumped up and hydrated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SAMANTHA's photos really speak for themselves.&nbsp;The texture on her cheek looked so much smoother with reduced redness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After one week, people started noticing significantly more hydration and reduced dryness. Skin started to look more even in tone, and bumps were starting to go away. Pores were also starting to appear less visible.</p>
<h3><strong>After Two&nbsp;</strong><strong>Weeks</strong></h3>
<p>The redness on ALIVIA's cheeks was less visible, and her skin looked more even in tone and softer in texture. Her eye area, in particular, looked much brighter, giving her a more awake appearance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The texture on the side of PHYLLIS&nbsp;looked visibly smoother and more translucent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BERTHE writes, ""My skin texture has improved; my skin seems to be firmer and my pores are barely noticeable. I never leave the house without at least some light foundation but went out a couple of times without wearing any makeup other than my lipstick and felt comfortable."" Her hyperpigmentation on her forehead and cheeks appeared visibly reduced. Her skin also looked less oily and much more balanced, giving her skin an almost airbrushed finish with a creamy, even luminosity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MELISSA's skin started to look brighter, more luminous and radiant—basically, more like glass, so much that she couldn't resist smiling in her photo!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After two weeks passed, people started getting compliments from friends and coworkers. Skin started to look brighter with a more lit-from-within glow—that classic luminosity that comes with skin that looks like glass.&nbsp;Skin also started to feel softer and smoother. Dry spots or oily spots also started to go away as skin became more visibly balanced with sufficient hydration.</p>
<h3><strong>After Three Weeks</strong></h3>
<p>ARCHANA says, ""I really liked that the product was odor-free, absorbed quickly into my skin, and didn’t irritate or cause my skin to tingle. Even after just two weeks, my skin was noticeably softer and brighter."" After three weeks, her skin appeared so much smoother, her breakouts calming down and going away. Her dark spots and scarring also started to look much lighter, giving her skin more luminosity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Honestly, all around improvement,"" PUJA writes. ""My sister, who hasn't seen me in four months, asked what I am doing differently for my skin because it looks a lot better. Blemishes are lighter. Skin is much more glowy."" Not only did her breakouts calm down, but her redness and&nbsp;acne scarring looked visibly improved. Her skin, overall, looked more hydrated and calmer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three weeks of consistent use started to reduce the appearance of pores as skin looked visibly firmer and more plumped up. Skin also felt markedly softer and smoother, with deeper hydration helping skin look dewier, more luminous and well rested.</p>
<h3><strong>After Thirty Days</strong></h3>
<p>ALIVIA's skin looked markedly different after one month of use, looking more luminous and translucent. The texture of her skin looked smoother with less redness and more even tone. Her skin also had a brighter, more plumped-up appearance, especially around her eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MONICA says, ""I look forward to putting this serum on every day! It goes on very smoothly, and my skin absorbs it really quickly. After a month of use, my pores on my cheeks shrunk and the skin under my eyes have less wrinkles! I also can't believe it's non-toxic! I highly recommend this serum! You must try it!"" Her skin looked less dull and much more vibrant with a visible glow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After one month, the effect of the Glass Skin Refining Serum on the appearance of skin was much more obvious. Consistent use showed that skin was more deeply hydrated with a smoother appearance. Dark spots and scarring appeared lighter, and skin tone, in general, looked more even, consistent and translucent. Pores even looked much smaller. And skin was left with that hallmark luminous glow.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Skin that's so healthy and hydrated, it looks poreless, luminous, translucent—like glass. It sounds impossible, but, after using our&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.peachandlily.com/products/glass-skin-refining-serum"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Glass Skin Refining Serum </a>every day for 30 days, people found that glass skin is attainable. Glass skin goals can be achieved! And our Glass Skin Refining Serum is the perfect place to start.</p>
<p>With these dramatic results in mind (again, we did <em>no</em> Photoshopping or editing!), we’d love for you to try our 30 Glass Skin Challenge yourselves! Whether you’re new to our Glass Skin Refining Serum or not, document your skin journey with our Glass Skin Refining Serum over 30 days, and share your results with us, using our hashtag, #GlassSkinGoals!</p>

<h5><a href=""https://www.peachandlily.com/products/power-calm-hydrating-gel-cleanser"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser</strong></a></h5>
<p><em>My new HG cleanser. I have never been one to spend a ton of money on a cleanser. That said, I have rosacea and acne-prone skin so I figured I would give this a try. It is actually the most gentle and calming cleanser I have ever used. Brings down my redness and is super gentle. LOVE! </em>—Wynter D., Verified Buyer</p>
<p><em>I suffer from hormonal acne and this cleanser calms by bumps and reduces the redness associated with it. I also love the fact it does not have a strong scent, very subtle.</em> —Christine, Verified Buyer</p>
<p><em>I really like this cleanser. It’s really gentle but cleans my skin without stripping it. My two teenagers also like using this product. A big plus is that it does not smelly overly perfume like. My son appreciates that . Another plus is the packaging. Since it’s a tube we can get every last drop of product out. We will be purchasing in the future. </em>—Brein G., Verified Buyer</p>
<h5><a href=""https://www.peachandlily.com/products/the-good-acids-pore-toner"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Good Acids Pore Toner</strong></a></h5>
<p><em>I really love this toner. I wasn't sure if it was going to be harsh or drying because of the acids but it totally isn't! It has really helped to keep my skin balanced and clear even during hormonal times of the month. Such a great toner for everyday use — day and night.</em> —Jean K., Verified Buyer</p>
<p><em>After a few weeks of using this, my skin is noticeably clearer and pores are smaller. I have combination skin that tends to dry out in many places while also having blackheads and whiteheads in others. I use this toner once every day or two days, depending on how my skin feels. Paired with the glass skin serum, it has really made a difference.</em> —Kristiene G., Verified Buyer</p>
<p><em>I love this product! I am currently using a retinoid so this is a really great way to incorporate an AHA in my routine. It's super gentle and really just gives you very mellow exfoliation. I just put it straight on my face — no cottons required!</em> —Kate L., Verified Buyer</p>
<h5><a href=""https://www.peachandlily.com/products/wild-dew-treatment-essence"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Wild Dew Treatment Essence</strong></a></h5>
<p><em>It’s hard to fight skepticism when we hear lots of promises about yet another product on a market. And yet we try... And I’m glad I did. This product did not disappoint and became a new addition to my skin routine. The skin does feel and look fresh and moist all day long either in conditioned indoors or during adventures outdoors. Highly recommend to all who would like to add a little boost to their appearance. </em>—Ellada Z, Verified Buyer</p>
<p><em>I got a sample of the Wild Dew Treatment Essence. Since I got so much in that small sample and I didn’t want to waste it, I decided to just layer it on my skin. Wow!! It is sooo dewy!! It’s lightweight, NOT sticky, and very hydrating. I woke up the next morning and my face has a nice glow. I decided to purchase the bottle. I honestly love this product! I first I thought it was very pricey, but now that I’ve been using it, I honestly believe it’s worth every penny. </em>—Peta, Verified Reviewer&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The texture is really like the perfect consistency and it soaks into the skin really well, immediate hydration for sure. It leaves a slight tacky feel but you do know that it’s all the good stuff you are getting and none of those silicone and alcohol infused serums that make your skin smooth like silk, temporary. I have dehydrated, sensitive skin and this one works for me very well.</em> —Lim C., Verified Buyer</p>
<h5><a href=""https://www.peachandlily.com/products/super-reboot-resurfacing-mask"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Super Reboot Resurfacing Mask</strong></a></h5>
<p><em>My skin is very sensitive and acne prone and this mask is perfect! My face got brighter and smoother. My skin tone is becoming more even and my existing acne is fading away. I use it every 3 days. Usually exfoliation causes more irritation and breakouts for me, but not with this mask. I may have had a few tiny pimples after my first use but then everything calmed down before the second use. I love this product! Will definitely continue to purchase.</em> —Suzanne E., Verified Buyer</p>
<p><em>Ever since using this mask 2x a week my skin has become noticeably more clear and refreshed. I moved to a humid climate roughly six months ago and have been struggling (to say the least) to rid myself of regular breakouts. This mask has helped do the trick. Yes, yes, yes.</em> —Christine D., Verified Buyer</p>
<p><em>Originally tried this as part of a test group and loved my sample so much that I bought the full size. I love Korean beauty products and the resurfacing mask is no exception. It makes my skin feel smoother and tighter after every use. It tingles slightly and i don’t love the smell but the results are well worth it. </em>—Jill D., Verified Buyer</p>
<h5><a href=""https://www.peachandlily.com/products/glass-skin-refining-serum"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Glass Skin Refining Serum</strong></a></h5>
<p><em>I have been using this serum for about 3 months and my skin has never looked better! For me, it's done a fantastic job of balancing my combination skin and keeping me hydrated. My skin looks bright and my complexion is clear – and it quickly healed breakouts from another product I had been using. I have very sensitive skin and this serum has worked wonders for me!</em> —Maria V., Verified Buyer</p>
<p><em>I tried not to get my hopes up too high but there was so much buzz about this product. I naturally have good skin with occasional breakouts, but this product (along with the matcha moisturizer) has really taken my skin next level--nearly glass skin status in just a couple of weeks. Skin tone is very even (which I have struggled with my entire life) and texture has smoothed out as well, and that's not something I knew I struggled with. But the serum has added natural radiance and a ""thickness"" to my skin--like how little kids have that bounce and collagen heavy look. Being closer to 40 than my 30s now, I'll take it! </em>—Roe M., Verified Buyer</p>
<p><em>I'm from Korea and have stuck to using K-beauty regimen my whole life. Up until high school, my skin was super clear. When I came to America for college, my skin went through a complete breakout and has been very slow to recover. I wanted my ""glass skin"" back and wanted to try this serum because the name stuck. I am always skeptical of how much a serum can impact a skin. In the end, it just feels like an additional product to help moisturize the skin. However, this serum was different. First of all, it's perfect for the summer because it is so lightweight and gets applied to the skin giving a supple hydration without leaving a heavy residue. I also love the very subtle scent because I hate it when a product feels too heavily scented (doesn't feel natural for me). The liquidy texture feels like the perfect touch before adding a moisturizer or a cream to finalize my skin regimen. Also, I have very sensitive, combination skin that is prone to acne with synthetic or chemical ingredients. This product did not break me out AT ALL and has been a wonderful aid to my slow recovery process. I would recommend the glass serum to someone who wants something to help balance out the moisture in their skin (a.k.a people with combination skin like me!). </em>—Yeni C. Verified Buyer</p>
<h5><a href=""https://www.peachandlily.com/products/pure-beam-luxe-oil"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Pure Beam Luxe Oil</strong></a></h5>
<p><em>Being combination skin I didn't think I'd like this oil and would only use it around my eyes and neckline as I'm also in my 60's. Wrong, I mix it into my moisturizer as well as directly on my eyes and neck. It isn't oily at all, just leaves my skin soft, glowing and feeling great with no oily shine at all. Love it.</em> —Carol L., Verified Buyer</p>
<p><em>I've been using this oil day and night and I usually only use oils at night because they tend to be heavy for me, especially since I have oily skin in the summer. However, this oil is so light weight and absorbs quickly and I haven't had any breakouts from it. My skin is glowing and I've noticed my skin tone has started to even out and my hyper-pigmentation is slowly fading. I definitely would recommend this oil to anyone who may be afraid to add oil to their routine, especially those with oily skin.</em> —Philicia, Verified Reviewer</p>
<p><em>This oil is the best oil I've used. It is lightweight and yet concentrated enough to soothe and hydrate my skin. I have oily skin but the oil does not add more oiliness onto it. The is the best oil I've purchased and will continue to use it in combination with the glass skin refining serum. </em>—Christine H., Verified Buyer</p>
<h5><a href=""https://www.peachandlily.com/products/matcha-pudding-antioxidant-cream"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Matcha Pudding Antioxidant Cream</strong></a></h5>
<p><em>No inflammation, perfect hydration, a little goes a long way! This is my new go-to. </em>—Lauren B., Verified Buyer</p>
<p><em>I have a mild rosacea issue, so I’m always looking for products that won’t make the redness situation worse. To complicate things, I dislike the feeling of thick, heavy creams, which are probably the best texture for my aging skin. Matcha Pudding seems like it would fall into the thick and heavy camp, but it is deceiving. It goes on the skin like a silky dream and is quickly absorbed. Yet my skin feels plumped and hydrated all night (and day) long. Will remain faithful to this one!</em> —Brian F., Verified Buyer</p>
<p><em>So far, I love this face cream! I have combination skin, where I have very dry spots and very oily spots (usually on my t zone) this cream is perfect for that, because it moisturizes my dry areas and doesn't over moisturize my oily areas. Its light, yet not too light that it's not moisturizing enough. It also makes my skin feel super soft and dewy. I highly recommend!! </em>—Sarah G., Verified Buyer</p>

<h5><a href=""https://www.peachandlily.com/products/lazy-day-all-in-one-moisture-pad"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Lazy Day All-in-One Moisture Pads</strong></a></h5>
<p><em>Sometimes I just don't want to do my whole routine. These pads cut out quite a bit of my nightly multi-step routine (which I'll still do 3-4 days of the week) and are great to use post-workout. They're an absolute must-have for me when I travel because I don't want to spend a lot of time on my normal routine, let alone have to deal with checking a bag for my other products.</em> —Rachel C., Verified Buyer</p>
<p><em>This product is amazing. I have sensitive skin that is blemish prone and large pores. I have had no problems with this product causing breakouts. My skin looks so much better being hydrated. And it's great when your running late in the mornings. </em>—Stacey T., Verified Buyer</p>
<p><em>True to its word! This product is great for my lazy days , but also really great for days when I'm breaking out a bit and my skin feels out of whack . When I don't want to overpower my skin with too many products, I think this really helps to re-balance my overall tone and texture. I will definitely put this in my holy grail, top 5, must have in my skincare arsenal.</em> &nbsp;—Sara Y., Verified Reviewer</p>
<h5><a href=""https://www.peachandlily.com/products/kbeauty-rescue-balm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>K-Beauty Rescue Balm</strong></a></h5>
<p><em>I love using this to treat my dry spots - from cuticles to my hairline, they need extra attention this time of year, either from the weather or the heater indoors. It absorbs quickly and easily and doesn't leave a gross, sticky residue you find with other moisturizers. Smell is fine. Be sure to squeeze the package to mix it up - it's pretty oily, so it can separate. &nbsp;</em>—Cat D., Verified Buyer</p>
<p><em>This rescue balm is amazing. I have very sensitive skin and most lotions will make my eczema break out all along my hands; this product healed my hands. When I received this product my knuckles were dry and cracking, and from trying different lotions to help heal my hands, I had an eczema breakout. After only 1 day of use, my knuckles were almost healed and my eczema was starting to calm down. I keep this in my purse for emergencies, because this needs to be with me at all times. Specifics about the balm: it is thick and then melts into you skin. It doesn't leave your skin feeling oily all day. It does not have a strong scent. A little goes a long way.</em> —Jenny, Verified Reviewer&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>I love this balm. I use it around my chin area, on my hands and arms when im feeling especially dry and rough. It is very heavy, almost a vaseline like texture, but so incredibly breathable- which was shocking to me! I have no concerns whatsoever about breaking out when i load it on! My favorite is to put a few layers and allow it to soak in overnight :) </em>&nbsp;—Josephine, Verified Reviewer</p>

62,"How I Cleared Up My Eczema: Alicia's Story",,,,peach-and-lily-collection:-real-stories-from-you-duplicated,,,,,,"
<p>Eczema is a lifelong struggle. To all of you out there with all variations of atopic dermatitis or chronic acne (to name but a few chronic skin issues), I feel you. It's frustrating when your skin simply won't cooperate when you're giving it so much attention and care.</p>
<p>I can never rid myself of eczema; there's no real cure for it. However, I've learned to manage my flare-ups, from the small ones to the big, persistent ones. Smaller episodes clear up pretty easily with the right care, but there are times that the flare-up is particularly raging and simply won't go away.</p>
<p>This past fall, I had what I call ""angry skin."" I had been testing all kinds of products, and some of the formulas were a bit drying. On top of that, I wasn't sleeping much. I know better than to scratch my skin relentlessly (once I do, the scarring lasts way longer), so I kept my nails short and tried to think about anything other than the intense itchiness. However, this was the kind of flare-up where it didn’t matter if I never touched a finger to my skin — the swelling was there, the bumps were there, and the rash was there with all its angry redness.</p>
<p>To get this flare-up under control, the first thing I did was take a diluted bleach bath. This is something that you can read about on the American Academy of Dermatology and the National Eczema Association as well! Basically, the bleach can help kill the bacteria that causes the itchiness, and it’s safe because the bleach is so diluted. I used about 1/3 cup of household bleach that has 5-8% sodium hypochlorite in a full tub of lukewarm water — to put that in context, a standard US tub fills up with about 40 gallons of water. That’s 1/3 cup of bleach in 40 gallons of water. I then soaked in this very diluted lukewarm bleach bath (neck down only, never submerging my face) for about 10 minutes. After draining, I rinsed off with clean lukewarm water, then towel-dried, not so my skin was completely dry but just on this side of damp.</p>
<p>I used a baby lotion, Mustela, slathering it liberally everywhere. On the super dry and itchy spots, I applied an extra layer of the KBeauty Rescue Balm, which is this incredibly hydrating do-it-all balm that really helps provide this feeling of relief as it just seems to coax skin into calming down and cooperating. It really is my rescue-product for all sorts of issues — chapped lips, hang nails and rough cuticles, cracked heels, you name it.</p>
<p>For my face, I made a DIY face pack using rolled oats and water and nothing else. I made a thick paste and smeared it onto cleansed skin, leaving it on for 10-15 minutes for the oats to work their soothing, comforting magic.</p>
<p>After I washed off that face pack and patted the excess water off my face, leaving my skin damp, I first applied the <a href=""https://www.peachandlily.com/products/wild-dew-treatment-essence"">Wild Dew Treatment Essence</a> because, when my skin is dehydrated, it can get even more finicky, and the Wild Dew Treatment Essence sinks so quickly into skin and really helps to quench deep skin thirst immediately. I followed that with a generous 4-5 pumps of the <a href=""https://www.peachandlily.com/products/glass-skin-refining-serum"">Glass Skin Refining Serum</a>, which really helps calm and soothe my skin — the Glass Skin Refining Serum contains healing and nourishing ingredients like madecassoside and the peach extract. Of course, the hyaluronic acid and niacinamide in the serum also help hydrate and brighten skin (and I love that too!), but, when my skin is acting up, it’s those soothing benefits that provide an almost instant relief for me. Finally, I squeezed a dime-sized amount of the <a href=""https://www.peachandlily.com/products/kbeauty-rescue-balm"">KBeauty Rescue Balm</a> onto my hands and pat-pat-patted it into my skin.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>My skin felt <em>so</em> much better; my rashes looked so much calmer; and I repeated this ritual a few more times, leaving a couple days in-between. And voila, my eczema flare-up calmed all the way down.</p>
<p>I have a lot of little rituals and go-to methods when it comes to eczema, so I'll be sure to share more! I'm not a dermatologist or a doctor, but I am an esthetician and, more importantly, someone who's dealt with eczema her whole life, so while you shouldn't take this as medical advice, I do hope my experience is helpful to some of you!</p>
<p>What are some of your favorite skincare hacks? Let me know below; I love hearing from you!</p>

It has no turn signals or mirrors, and features more aggressive ECU mapping, knobby tires, and is claimed to be 5 pounds lighter than the 500 EXC-F. The 500 XCF-W is 50-state legal and therefore green-sticker legal in California. This makes it an ideal choice for a rider who isn’t necessarily looking to race, rather someone who wants a bike they can legally trail ride year-round in more riding areas than they would be able to on a cross-country or motocross bike.</p>

(Petronas Yamaha Sepang Racing Team/)</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.cycleworld.com/tags/fabio-quartararo/"">Fabio Quartararo</a> was the true revelation of the 2019 <a href=""https://www.cycleworld.com/motogp-racing-news-results-features/"">MotoGP championship</a> and there is a lot of expectation around him for the upcoming season. 2020 should have been his year, but the COVID-19 pandemic has reshuffled the cards, and MotoGP riders will tackle a <a href=""https://www.cycleworld.com/story/motorcycle-racing/motogp-2020-schedule-announced/"">revised calendar</a> that resumes at Jerez, Spain, on July 19 with 13 races in less than four months. Twenty, by the way, is also Fabio’s magic number; it is his date of birth (April 20, 1999) and his racing number.</p>
<p>Quartararo is eager for the green flag to drop. The Frenchman will be called to deal with the astronomic pressure to prove that Yamaha made the right choice to contract him to its official factory team for the 2021 and 2022 seasons, and to conquer the hearts of the Valentino Rossi fans as he will take the Doctor’s seat.</p>
<p><strong>Maria Guidotti: On July 15 at Jerez you will jump back on your </strong><a href=""https://www.cycleworld.com/yamaha-monster-energy-motogp-launches-new-yzr-m1-under-signs-strong-evolution/""><strong>YZR-M1</strong></a><strong> after four and a half months without riding. </strong><a href=""https://www.cycleworld.com/story/motorcycle-racing/italian-motogp-stars-cope-with-lockdown/""><strong>How have you prepared during the COVID-19 pandemic?</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Fabio Quartararo:</strong> During the lockdown, I worked a lot on the cardio, as it was the only thing we could do. Once the government lifted the lockdown in Andorra, I returned training with my motocross bike. I feel physically fit and mentally ready to focus only on the track. It’s good that the season resumes with a day of testing on the same track on July 15. I think we will recover the pace quite easily because we know Jerez very well. The main difference will be the temperature—it will be much higher than what we used to find in April.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of championship do you expect?</strong></p>
<p>With such a tight calendar, it will be important not to take many risks, especially in the practice sessions. Regarding the race approach, last year I learned the lesson that it’s better not to override when we struggle.</p>

<p><strong>This year you are promoted to a factory-spec bike.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it’s a new bike for me as this winter I only did five days of testing. I’m really excited to return on track and I’m confident that we can do well. My target is to fight for the podium and possibly for the victory every Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>When you joined the Moto3 class at just 15 years old, the pressure almost crushed you. How do you deal with the pressure now?</strong></p>
<p>I have learned how to deal with the pressure that comes from the high expectations of the people. Nowadays, it’s just a positive motivation. I’m relaxed and focused thanks to the fact that I have a contract with Yamaha until 2022. This was my priority. Now I can focus only on track results.</p>
<p><strong>How can </strong><a href=""https://www.cycleworld.com/tags/marc-marquez/""><strong>Marc Márquez</strong></a><strong> be beaten?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t know yet, but I hope to discover it soon.</p>

<p><strong>You are considered Márquez’s main rival? How do you feel about it?</strong></p>
<p>This is a good sign. It means we have been working well. Moreover, I have a good relationship with Marc. On track we are rivals, but off track we are friends. When I joined Moto3, I used to race for Emilio Alzamora’s team (Márquez’s manager). I had the chance to talk with him [Marc] many times and to ask for advice.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think the relationship with Márquez will change?</strong></p>
<p>After<a href=""https://www.cycleworld.com/story/motorcycle-racing/marc-marquez-ends-2019-motogp-season-with-victory-at-valencia/""> the [2019] Valencia GP</a>, Marc told me I would be a strong rival in 2020.

<p><strong>What is Márquez’s strongest point?</strong></p>
<p>He has many strengths, but I’m always impressed by his adaptation skills. He is fast no matter if it’s wet, windy, or super hot.</p>
<p><strong>In 2021, you will take </strong><a href=""https://www.cycleworld.com/tags/valentino-rossi/""><strong>Valentino Rossi</strong></a><strong>’s spot at factory Yamaha. How do you feel to be Valentino’s replacement? </strong></p>
<p>It’s an incredible feeling. When I was a kid, I used to wait outside Valentino’s motorhome for an autograph. I’m still not realizing what it will be like to ride for the factory Yamaha team. I also never expected to ride with him. I have a good relationship with him and, for me, it’s a dream come true.</p>

<p><strong>If you had to choose a quality of Valentino to have yourself, which would you pick?</strong></p>
<p>The image and the relationship he has with the fans. I remember the podium celebrations he used to do in 125cc. It was pure fun and people loved it. Even my grandmother, who didn’t follow MotoGP, knew about the Doctor! <a href=""https://www.cycleworld.com/sport-rider/valentino-rossi-impact-on-motogp-rossi-effect/"">He was able to reach an incredibly wide audience.</a> I also like his battles, his aggressive riding style. His passes on Sete Gibernau and Casey Stoner remain remarkable.</p>
<p><strong>Will you be able to capture Rossi fans?</strong></p>
<p>When I signed, I actually wondered if Valentino’s fans would see me and if they would be happy. I hope they are on my side as <a href=""https://www.cycleworld.com/sport-rider/video-valentino-rossi-doctor-series-part-5/"">I also grew up as a fan of the number 46</a>.</p>","2020-07-05 09:24:48","2021-05-14 21:03:01","2020-07-05 00:00:00",1,1,,magefan_blog/motocycle-01.jpg,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ducati is at EICMA 2018 with a substantial number of new or revised models, but the real piece of supreme engineering is the Panigale V4 R, a 998cc version of the 90 degree V-4 that last year claimed the title of most powerful street-legal, naturally aspirated bike, extracting 214 hp from its 1,103cc unit. We all knew that the final target of the Panigale V4 project was to create the ultimate Superbike series contender—the bike that would bring the World SBK championship back to Borgo Panigale. Indeed, the just unveiled Panigale V4 R seems to be ready to stand up to those expectations.",,27,

<p class=""paragraph | margin_bottom_lg margin_centered"">The fine line between failure and success passes through the human mind. Mastering massive horsepower, bewildering electronics, and careful tire selection is usually not enough to make the difference in motorcycle roadracing; a mental approach is often more important than simply opening the throttle. Monster Energy Yamaha <a href=""https://www.cycleworld.com/motogp-racing-news-results-features/"">MotoGP</a> rider <a href=""https://www.cycleworld.com/tags/maverick-vinales/"">Maverick Viñales</a> knows it well. “I think I changed more than the bike,” confessed the Spaniard last year, acknowledging an empowered self-confidence that helped him turn a difficult season around. “I changed my way of thinking, my approach, and the riding style.

The 88-degree V-twin is bolted to a backbone frame, but provides much of the bike’s structure itself. At the back there’s a self-supporting carbon fiber subframe, while up front a Hossack-style double-wishbone suspension arrangement is used, as on Brough’s other current models.</p>

The body holding the fin and supporting the saddle is one of the areas where we called on the unique knowledge of Mecano ID, who joined the project to apply specialist aerospace-quality carbon fiber skills to the exclusive AMB 001.”</p>

Back then, Boxer built the Lamborghini Design 90 at the behest of Lambo’s then-owners the Mimram brothers, featuring a Kawasaki engine and distinctively straked bodywork that was intended to mimic the increasingly outrageous Countach supercar of the era. Despite plans to make as many as 50 of the machines, only six were built before Chrysler bought struggling Lamborghini in 1987. Let’s hope the Aston Martin AMB 001 has a better fate.</p>

68,"Detailed info on the Clay Bodies",,,,detailed-info-on-the-clay-bodies,,,,,,"<p class="""">All clays except terra cotta and sculpture are recommended for wheel.</p>
<p class="""">Sand Clay. A finely grogged clay. This clay is beautiful, it looks like wet beach sand when left unglazed with a grainy, speckled surface. The speckles do not show through glazes and underglazes applied over this clay body but it will bring the color of glazes down.<br>Cone 6 Shrinkage 13.5% Absorption 3.0%</p>
<p class="""">Brooklyn red. Standard 308.<br>This is one of the most widely used clays in public studios for a reason. It is a brick red stoneware body with fine sand and fine grog. Very resistant to warping and bloating. Yields a beautiful dark reddish brick color and can bring depth and richness to the glazes applied to it.<br>Cone 6 Shrinkage 12.5% Absorption 2.0%</p>
<p class="""">Dark Brown Clay.<br>People love this clay because it is so dark. This clay creates major depth and richness in color as it greatly affects the glazes applied over it. The clay is smooth and plastic and good for all techniques. It may take longer to clean up your wheel splash pan with all the iron in this clay.<br>Cone 6 Shrinkage 13% Absorption 1.0%</p>
<p class="""">Porcelain. Wins most vitrified award meaning that this clay is nonporous and very food safe even without glaze. Porcelain boasts a super smooth and creamy texture and contains no grog. Glazes are bright and brilliant on this clay especially semi translucent glazes like celadons. Its a great choice if you are staining clay bodies with mason stains or oxides (Nerikomi/Agateware). It is however more prone to cracking while drying and warping than other clays but worth it to obtain the super white color. Recommended for intermediate to experienced potters.<br>Cone 6 Shrinkage 13.0% Absorption 0.3%</p>
<p class="""">White Stoneware. Fires a bright warm off-white color. This is a good clay for beginners because the glazes show up on it with very bright colors.&nbsp; This clay has some of the finest grog we have ever seen which enhances its throwing qualities and strength while leaving the clay feeling smooth.<br>Cone 6 Shrinkage 10.0% Absorption 0.75%</p>
<p class="""">Sculpture clay. Standard 420.<br>A highly grogged body, formulated for sculpture. Yellowish tan color at C/6.<br>This clay is a beautiful gray color when wet but don’t let that fool you, the clay fires a light straw tone. This clay is full of sandy gritty grog which can hurt some peoples hands when they throw with it. For this reason we do not recommend it for throwing (although some do). This clay is highly moldable and sticky. It is an excellent sculpture clay, producing works that dry evenly with less cracking and low shrinkage (only 8% vs the usual double digits).<br>Cone 6 Shrinkage 8.0% Absorption 1.5%</p>
<p class="""">Speckled clay. Standard 112.<br>This clay is definitely having a moment. This is THE most popular clay at Mouse Ceramic Studio. Maybe its because the speckles in the clay show through glazes and underglazes, effectively making every glaze you apply to it into a speckled glaze. This clay will not reveal its speckled surface until its fired to glaze temperature.<br>C/6 Shrinkage 11.0% Absorption 2.25%</p>
<p class="""">Terra Cotta Sculpture Clay. Standard 108.<br>This clay gives the lovely earth tones associated with terra cotta but its actually a high fire stoneware. Great for sculpture, very rough for wheel throwing although we have seen it done. This clay is rough and not recommended for wheel use (although we have seen it done (Matt K!)).<br>Cone 6 Shrinkage 10.5% Absorption 5.0%</p>

It is maybe one of the most beautiful brown clays available, not to light and not too dark, full of rich deep tones that really bring out the beauty of glazes.

We charge $0.04 per cubic inch to fire in a community firing. (Except for members), each time the work is fired, it must be paid for. Measure your piece with an inch ruler or measuring tape, you will need the length, the width, and the height, the length is the longest dimension of your piece (usually) from side to side, the width is usually front to back, and the height is the measurement from top to bottom or how tall it is. Each measurement needs to multiplied by the next so length x width x height. This will give you the cubic inches of the piece; take that amount and multiply by 0.04 to get your dollar amount. For example, a cup with handle that is 6x4x4 is 96 cubic inches; 96 x 0.04 = 3.84 so the total for this mug would be $3.84 per firing or $7.68 for bisque and glaze firing.

<p class="""">630<br>Gray (White) Stoneware. This is the clay we used to provide in the communal buckets. Contains fire clay and mullite which (supposedly) enhances thermal properties. Fires grayish and the fired unglazed clay looks like white stoneware at cone ten. This is a good clay for beginners because the grog in the clay helps prevent cracking during drying.&nbsp; Some people have experienced bloating issues with this clay body.</p>

<p class="""">240<br>Ivory (White) Stoneware.<br>A very smooth, plastic throwing body. This clay doesn’t have grog so it is more prone to cracking during drying, dry slowly to avoid this, not having grog allows you to sponge smooth this clay. 240 is a great clay for those who are nervous about trying porcelain but want a very smooth lighter colored clay.

71,"Pigd's final three classes",,,,how-to-plant-your-living-pot-duplicated,,,,,,"<p class="""">Last Friday’s Zoom topic is on for today. Betty Woodman!</p>
<p class="""">Born in Norwalk, Connecticut, Betty Woodman attended the School for American Craftsmen at Alfred University in New York from 1948 to 1950. She has taught in the Fine Arts Department of the University of Colorado.</p>
<p class="""">A leading ceramist whose inventive forms and painterly use of color have won her international renown, Woodman began her career making simple functional pottery. Although her ambitious experiments with clay have wrought great changes in her work, it still refers to some practical function even if her baroque, expressive forms are no longer strictly utilitarian. Woodman's art has been inspired by diverse sources, ranging from Etruscan and Minoa to Tange and majolica ceramics.</p>
<p class="""">The recipient of fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1980 and 1986, Woodman has also been a guest artist at the experimental atelier of the Manufacture National de Sevres in France.</p>
<p class="""">Kenneth R. Trapp and Howard Risatti&nbsp;<em>Skilled Work: American Craft in the Renwick Gallery</em>&nbsp;(Washington, D.C.: National Museum of American Art with the Smithsonian Institution Press, 1998)</p>
<p class=""""><strong>Artist Biography</strong></p>
<p class="""">Betty Woodman first became interested in crafts because her father was a woodworker. In high school, one ceramics course was sufficient to convince Woodman that she wanted to be a functional potter. Studying pottery at the School for American Craftsmen at Alfred University, she developed a strong interest in the history of ceramics. Her first job after graduating in 1950 was as a production potter, and that technical facility and experience were to be the foundation of her subsequent innovations. In 1952 Woodman traveled to Italy, where exposure to traditions such as majolica opened her eyes to the potential of clay.</p>
<p class="""">It was not until the seventies that Woodman completely abandoned her functional approach. Collaborating with important figures in the Pattern and Decoration movement, such as Joyce Kozloff and Cynthia Carlson, she began producing colorful, witty—and nonfunctional—vessels decorated with scenes from the Italian Renaissance or slathered with landscape clouds. Woodman's eccentric shapes and glazes are often appropriated from other cultures; her work in a sense functions as a very personal interpretation of art history. While the artist still produces human- and tabletop-size works, in recent years she has increased her scale, creating environmental installations for museums and galleries in the United States and abroad.</p>
<p id=""yui_3_17_2_1_1596269656856_1475"" class="""">Check out the video below of the late artist talking about her work.</p>","2021-04-11 21:01:52","2021-05-14 21:03:01","2021-04-11 00:00:00",1,1,,magefan_blog/ceramics-04.jpg,"Detailed info on the Clay Bodies",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,28,

73,"Your First Look at Every Stunning Bag from Chanel’s Cruise 2022 Show",,,,your-first-look-at-every-stunning-bag-from-chanels-cruise-2022-show,,,,,,"<p>Last June following months of lockdown and uncertainty for all of us, Chanel presented its Cruise collection in a digital format for the first time ever. As a brand that relies heavily on the art of the fashion show as a character in and of itself, it was both unique and sad to see the collection presented with such little fanfare. Now, the art of the show is back at Chanel for Cruise, and it is back in a big way. The brand presented its Cruise 2021/22 collection earlier this week at the Carrières de Lumières or Quarries of Light, which is located in the South of France. Made up of beautiful white limestone caves that resemble little rooms, the stunning location served as a monumental backdrop for the Chanel Cruise 2021/22 show.</p>

<p>The venue evokes the simplicity and precision of the collection, playing on the contrast of the modernity of the black and white pieces that were presented with nods to the era of punk rock. The RTW overall is playful and fun, featuring odes to the past such as tweed suiting paired with graphic punk rock tees, fishnets and spaghetti strap dresses. The collection feels youthful and fresh but in a way that's relatable.</p>

<p>As for the bags, the collection is full of fresh takes on wearable neutrals with detailing such as chains, color blocking and fringe. Luxe fabrics like tweed and velvet also adorn flap bags, offering a new and wearable take on classic silhouettes. Flap bags with a twist are some of the collections most covetable, and wearable pieces, like a black and white color-blocked Classic Flap as well as one that features gold hardware detailing. Chanel under Virginie Viard is far more demure than in the past, but Viard is an expert at creating pieces that the consumer wants, ones that work for day to day wear and beyond. The Cruise 2021/22 collection will likely hit stores in November, but until then take a look below at every bag from the runway.</p>

Receiving a significant amount of exposure whether it be via influencer marketing or a general social media presence, the bag spawned a multi-bag revolution of sorts. A variety of other brands released multi-bag silhouettes, and Louis Vuitton themselves even designed a slew of other multi-bags for both women and men. As the Multi Pochette Accessoires gained popularity, it became nearly impossible to find, making the price via the resale market skyrocket all the while. It sold out virtually everywhere, including online and in almost all LV boutiques around the world. Today it is still unavailable online in both Khaki and Light Pink classic Monogram. It’s also worth noting that this bag has gone up in price by $500 since it was first released. This new icon is here to stay and today we’re giving you a look at the latest from Louis Vuitton. Leather logo lovers rejoice and take a look at the Multi Pochette Accessoires in Monogram Empreinte leather. Like the original, this all-leather version is perfectly sized to carry the essentials, with two separate pouches that can be worn together or separate. The new version features the same silhouette with a sleek leather strap that is designed to be worn over the shoulder or it can be adjusted to be worn crossbody with the hidden adjustable snaps. The main difference is that it does not come with the removable coin pouch, so this version is actually 2 pieces versus 3. An added and elegant touch is also applied to the chain strap, which is interwoven with a leather detailing. Louis-Vuitton-Bicolor-Multi-Pochette Louis-Vuitton-Solid-Multi-Pochette Currently there are two Empreinte leather options available—bicolor and monochrome leather, and while both are shown in oversized embossed Monogram giant, the bicolor version contrasts with solid leather side gussets while the monochromatic version alternates with a classic Monogram pattern on the sides. Both versions are supple and lightweight, available in black as well as cream, the solid costs $2,230 and the bicolor retails for $2,490. At publishing time, both options are still ready to add to cart, so act fast if you want to get your hands on one! Are you running to snag this bag?</p>","2021-05-07 19:41:46","2021-05-14 21:03:01","2020-11-23 00:00:00",1,1,,magefan_blog/handbag-02.jpg,"The Bottega Veneta Devotee",1,,,,,,,,,,,,"Since debuting in late 2019, Louis Vuitton’s Multi Pochette Accessoires has positioned itself as one of fashion’s most sought-after handbags.

For clarification, I’m not talking about a big bag for work or travel. I mean to carry to a lunch date or a day shopping, etc. To carry it for the style of it, not necessarily b/c you need to carry a ton of stuff.” PurseForum member KimTX’s comment in the thread “I am falling back in LoVe with BIG bags” had me speculating: Is there such a thing as the “right” size for a bag? I mean of course, there’s me (and so many of you out there) who’d haul luggage around if it was something I really liked. Speaking of which, remember that gigantic red Hermès Haut à Courroies Katie Holmes (whose bag choices I simply adore) carried? Yeah, that’s the kind of big bag person I am. It’s (sometimes) justified too, because of course some of us do need to stow away our laptops, gym clothes, extra pairs of shoes and umbrellas as well as our children and/or significant others in our bags. Of course.</p>
<p>But then there are those of us who are content with carrying just a petit Jacquemus for our daily needs, and I secretly suspect that you guys have gigantic totes hidden in your trunks that may or may not have people in them…</p>
<p>Honestly though, even if a Jacquemus isn’t necessarily your daily carry, there are those of us who can condense our lives into a Chanel 2.55, a Balenciaga Hourglass or a clutch/pouch equivalent. And ever so often, these women (or men) are terrified that any bag larger than the aforementioned would overpower their frames and, as so many TPFers fear, that the “bag would wear you instead of you wearing the bag”.</p>
<p>So it isn’t just the load you need to carry around throughout the day, but also your proportions too is a thing to consider when judging a bag. Even then, a range of factors come into play, like petite wearers should wear smaller bags and taller users should opt for bigger purses. Top-heavy people should consider crossbody bags and bottom-heavy ones should go for bags that sit above the hip—the list is endless. I’m sure there are just as many variations to this as the number of body types that exist on Earth. Don’t even get me started on the backpack-wearing crowd because why would a person purposely want to look like a mule, right? Unless you’re going to work I suppose, but even then are backpacks really formal? These are the questions that keep me up at night.</p>
<p>Speaking of work, which again brings me to the loads we carry, some TPFers are of the opinion that if they use a bigger bag they are more drawn to carrying extra, irrelevant things that they don’t really need. That is a legitimate concern I can relate to because why else would my backpacking friend carry a bicycle jack to a hiking trip we weren’t even cycling during? True story.</p>
<p>Additionally, some of us inevitably wind up carrying not only the bunch of miscellaneous flotsam that we absolutely can’t do without, but also a motley flock of every Avenger action figure there is. Not to mention the food and clothes of your little ones too. In fact, my mom’s leather tote now has a permanently debossed Spiderman-face on it! (It was my younger brother’s. I don’t play with Spidermen. I don’t know why I needed to clarify that, but I digress…)</p>
<p>Finally, if you do happen to stumble upon the elusive “right” size of a bag, something else seems to be off. Either the handles are too short, the crossbody strap is too long, or the bag doesn’t have feet. Or maybe it’s a “black hole” where all of your stuff gets lost. Perhaps it lacks the requisite top zipper that you absolutely can’t do without. Eventually, all of these shortcomings have you questioning whether there really is something like a “perfect purse”.</p>
<p>While in all honesty I am in no capacity to judge what size of bag a person should carry because, as Megs says so often, the heart wants what the heart wants. I’m sure I myself will soon be obsessing over the next oversized clutch which, in hindsight, seems like a bit of a paradox, but I’d love to know what kind of bag-person are you? Are you a micro, small, medium, large, extra large, XXL, north-south, east-west or inside-out wearer? Seriously, I’d love to know because I see the sizes or types of bags we prefer (and often the uniquely frustrating issues we face with them) as a celebration of diversity and freedom of choice.</p>
<p>Clearly Shakespeare too was indecisive when he wrote in Macbeth, “to each his own”. But I think ultimately he was a big-bag person at heart because I’m quite sure he also said, “a bag could never be too big”. Either him or Jennifer Lopez. Probably him.</p>","2021-05-07 19:43:34","2021-05-14 21:03:01","2021-05-07 00:00:00",1,1,,magefan_blog/handbag-05.jpg,"The Bottega Veneta Devotee",1,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>“What about you?

Many times when I share my finds, I’m asked how I sourced it and more often than not, get asked my tips for shopping on the two platforms. Keep scrolling for my tips and techniques on what and how to buy to score the best vintage the inter-webs have to offer.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id=""h-tips-and-tricks-for-shopping-on-ebay-and-etsy""><strong>TIPS AND TRICKS&nbsp;</strong>FOR SHOPPING ON EBAY AND ETSY</h2>
<p><strong>Take your time</strong>&nbsp;– The thing about having the luxury of looking at items online means that you’re also up against thousands of other people doing the same thing. Try not to buy things out of desperation to get them and take your time to make sure it’s what you want. Once you take the time and your dream item becomes available, you’ll know and you’ll have done the due diligence to feel confident pushing ‘add to cart.’&nbsp;It’s always great to start with a list of items or trends you’re shopping and sticking to that to find that special piece.</p>
<p><strong>Get specific</strong>&nbsp;– If you know what you’re looking for, the best thing you can do is get as specific about it as possible. I’ve included a list at the bottom of this blog of my top 20 search terms and keywords, but I encourage you to create your own to fit your personal style. There’s an option to set alerts for yourself when items come into the ether that match your search terms – use this beautiful tool to your advantage. Yes,&nbsp;<strong><a class=""external"" href=""https://bit.ly/2V8SzMr"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener nofollow"">eBay</a></strong>&nbsp;allows you to save your search and it will notify you when a new item is listed using your search terms. Also, when you find inspiration for an item or outfit, write it down and input those search words into your searches.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Schedule shopping time into your day –&nbsp;</strong>Let me be the first to tell you that eBay and&nbsp;<strong><a class=""external"" href=""https://bit.ly/33ErjF2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener nofollow"">Etsy</a></strong>&nbsp;can be blackholes. Once you start searching for something, you will eventually end up finding something else that might be on your list and/or radar. By setting a limit of time that you can shop, you’ll be more conscious of what you look at and click on, and likely end up spending less money on some things you may not need. I say about 30-60 minutes should do that trick.</p>
<p><strong>Search often –&nbsp;</strong>Similar to how often you thrift shop in person, the more treasures you find, the online marketplace is an even bigger ocean with thousands of pieces becoming available every minute. Hop on during a break at work or right before bed to see what may have come available. This gives you a chance to ‘sleep on it’ and/or be the first to grab something you’ve been waiting on.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Haggle your way to a better price –&nbsp;</strong>The beauty of&nbsp;<strong><a class=""external"" href=""https://bit.ly/2V8SzMr"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener nofollow"">eBay</a></strong>&nbsp;is that it’s a platform made for bidding. This means that if you see a price, it doesn’t make it final and it can be negotiated. If an item has been up for sale for a long period of time, use that to your advantage, letting a seller know you’re very interested in buying and would be willing to purchase immediately for a specific price. If you’re not worried about bidding, you can also use the ‘buy it now’ feature which takes it right off the website and into your hands (after shipping and handling). On Etsy, I’ll send the seller a note and ask what the best price is they can offer for the item. 90% of the time this results in savings!</p>
<p><strong>Know your sizing –&nbsp;</strong>I suggest learning your measurements in both CM and IN so that no matter what it’s listed as online, you’re aware of where it may fall on you. Many times, refunds aren’t possible on eBay and&nbsp;<strong><a class=""external"" href=""https://bit.ly/33ErjF2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener nofollow"">Etsy</a></strong>, so it’s good to know that what you’re buying is either close to your sizing or can be tailored to your body.&nbsp;It’s important to remember that vintage sizing is very different than modern sizing so you always want to buy based on measured size, not labeled size.</p>
<p><strong>Use popular search terms –&nbsp;</strong>The following are my top 20 most used eBay search terms but you’ll want to figure out what works best for you and your search. I’m also in the middle of working on a guide with even more search terms and by category, so&nbsp;<strong><a class=""external"" href=""http://eepurl.com/bJyXtT"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener nofollow"">sign up here</a></strong>&nbsp;to be notified as soon as that becomes available.</p>","2021-06-22 19:16:48","2021-06-22 19:22:10","2021-06-15 00:00:00",1,1,,magefan_blog/blog01.jpg,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,30,27

Yes, I buy a lot of designer stuff and I have&nbsp;<em><strong>expensive</strong></em>&nbsp;taste, but there are some things that I just can’t justify. Enter the classic vintage St John cardigan which will solve the dilemma (if not affording Chanel is a dilemma).</p>
<p>I picked up my vintage St John cardigan for under $15 on&nbsp;<a class=""external"" href=""https://bit.ly/3hcCLzV"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener nofollow"">eBay</a>&nbsp;a few months ago and it’s one of my favorite finds ever. It’s one of those classic pieces I’ll wear well into my 100s, yes I plan to live to at least 100 years old, and will still be in style. These cardigans can tend to look a little too “buttoned up, pearl necklace” for my taste, but styled with the right pieces, it’s super modern and fashion forward. I love the contrast trim and the extra gaudy buttons which make the sweaters extra special.</p>
<p>My formula is to style with&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.avintagesplendor.com/guide-vintage-levis/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">vintage Levi’s</a>&nbsp;or leather pants and a graphic tee. It makes for a great cardigan over dresses for a most classic look, but you know I love mixing everything up when I get dressed up.</p>

79,"Thrifting, Estate Sales & More",,,,thrifting-estate-sales-and-more,,,,,,"<p>When it comes to shopping, 95% of the time I shop secondhand and vintage. The other 5%, I’ll shop a new piece that’s sustainably made and can highlight my current wardrobe and give it a bit of a refresh. With this in mind, it’s a passion of mine to peruse and shop vintage on a weekly basis. No matter if it’s online or in store, finding a one-of-a-kind piece or something I’ve been on the hunt for is an accomplishment I relish.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Flea Markets</strong></p>
<p>If you follow me on stories, you know my favorite way to shop clothing is at a flea market. It’s my own meditation to go browse the different tents and sections of these markets, hoping to find something on my list or my next great deal. A lot of people get overwhelmed by them, which I can totally understand, but the key is to be organized. Know what you’re shopping for, have a budget, and set a time limit for yourself (quite frankly, a game changer to shopping… just ask my husband). I set out a few of my favorite tips when it comes to mastering the art of shopping flea markets&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.avintagesplendor.com/shopping-for-vintage-clothing-fleamarket/"">here</a>&nbsp;as well as the Rose Bowl Flea Market&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.avintagesplendor.com/tips-for-shopping-the-rose-bowl-flea-market/"">here</a>. Whatever market you’re headed to, they’re always worth a walk through, if nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>Thrift Stores</strong></p>
<p>Thrift stores are great for rainy days when you can walk in and take your time perusing the racks. They require more digging, as they often are not as ‘curated’ as other platforms, but we all know this is when you can find diamonds in the rough. Salvation Army and Goodwill can be priced quite low, so you can get a lot of bang for your buck. Other higher end thrift stores will still provide a discount and you’ll be saving the Earth from waste, but you’ll find a higher ticket price more often than not.&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.avintagesplendor.com/5-items-to-always-buy-at-the-thrift-store/"">There are certain items I always buy from thrift stores</a>&nbsp;– I’ve found some of my greatest pairs of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.avintagesplendor.com/guide-vintage-levis/"">Levi’s</a>&nbsp;from thrift stores and it’s where I tell all my friends and followers to go for them!</p>","2021-06-22 19:19:44","2021-06-22 19:21:56","2021-06-15 00:00:00",1,1,,magefan_blog/blog04.jpg,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,30,27

<div class=""wp-block-group__inner-container"">
<p>One of my favorite things to buy for friends and family is always vintage because I love finding unique pieces for everyone on my shopping list. I get it, though, not everyone understands our obsession with vintage so deciding what to buy your friends and family can be tough. I think it’s important to consider the recipient and their interests (of course), but also what story you can share about the specific gift, item, designer, etc. My experience is even if someone isn’t into vintage, they always appreciate when I tell them why I bought it and the story behind it.</p>
<p>The best items to buy vintage as gifts are accessories, jewelry, jewelry boxes and bags. With these items, you don’t have to worry about sizing and they are pieces that everyone can appreciate and use. I think jewelry, jewelry boxes and silk scarves are perfect gifts for your mom or sister. I love the idea of bags for a younger sister or friend. If you’re looking to splurge for a partner or yourself, definitely look at designer bags and jewelry like Hermes or Chanel.</p>

81,"5 Benefits of Swimming for Exercise. The best workouts out there",,,,5-benefits-of-swimming-for-exercise,,,,,,"<div>You know how people are always talking about eating seasonally? Cherries and zucchini in June, and corn and peaches in July? We like to think that working out can be seasonal, too, and with summer in full swing, that means lots and lots of swimming.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you don’t have access to an indoor swimming pool during winter months, the arrival of hot summer days means finding a body of water where you can swim ASAP (pool, lake, ocean, it doesn’t matter). Besides beating the heat, swimming has a ton of health benefits that no other exercise can touch.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>According to&nbsp;<strong><a class=""gl-link"" href=""https://blogs.bmj.com/bjsm/2017/06/23/major-new-study-health-benefits-swimming-released/#:~:text=Swimming%20is%20uniquely%20placed%20to,children%20to%20develop%20skills%20quicker."" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-di-id=""di-id-d48bf84d-96b7f1f"">this study</a></strong>, one benefit of swimming is that it can lower the risk of an early death by 28%. Some other studies have shown that swimming benefits include&nbsp;<strong><a class=""gl-link"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28155720/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-di-id=""di-id-34bd9e18-b9dda46a"">lowering blood pressure</a></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><a class=""gl-link"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27473445/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-di-id=""di-id-34bd9e18-1dbeffd3"">controlling blood sugar</a></strong>. Need more reasons why the benefits of swimming run deep? Dive in below.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<h2>BENEFIT #1: IT’S ONE OF THE GREATEST FORMS OF CARDIO.</h2>
<div>“By nature, swimming is an oxygen deprivation exercise,” says Executive Director of&nbsp;<strong><a class=""gl-link"" href=""https://www.teamunify.com/Contact.jsp?team=scslasc"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-di-id=""di-id-f4f38661-efb120e3"">Los Angeles Swim Club</a></strong>&nbsp;Jason Schwarz. “You have to hold your breath for extended periods of time. Being an&nbsp;<strong><a class=""gl-link"" href=""https://www.reebok.com/us/blog/511332-why-you-need-both-anaerobic-and-aerobic-workouts"" data-di-id=""di-id-3fa2df37-1bdbd979"">aerobic exercise</a></strong>, it really expands the heart and lungs. The stronger the heart, the more efficient it becomes at pumping oxygen-soaked blood through the body. The lung power one can develop over time is remarkable.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>“<strong><a class=""gl-link"" href=""https://www.reebok.com/us/blog/508710-breathwork-101-a-mental-escape-for-those-who-need-it-right-now"" data-di-id=""di-id-f12fc917-232a854"">Breathwork</a></strong>&nbsp;is incredibly important in swimming,” says swim instructor and NCAA swim coach&nbsp;<strong><a class=""gl-link"" href=""https://coachlainie.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-di-id=""di-id-dcd26682-59a0c844"">Lainie Cassel</a></strong>. “Breathing is not something most people were taught properly when they learned how to swim. If they were, many aren’t aware of how they’re breathing. Breath is the foundation of movement but it’s almost always overlooked, even in high-level athletes. Because of this, it’s the first thing I teach to everyone I work with—from beginners to elite age-group swimmers.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Schwarz says breathing and the timing of the breath can be one of the most challenging aspects of swimming for exercise. “You really need to get the core, the body and spine in line with the head as it rotates to breathe,” he says. “During freestyle, your body should see-saw with every stroke from shoulder to shoulder. Instead of turning the head to breathe, allow your head to go with your body to get that breath. It’s a much more natural progression to breathe than forcing your head to turn.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<h2>BENEFIT #2: YOUR BODY LOVES TO WORK OUT IN WATER.</h2>
<div>“I work with a lot of runners and triathletes who have sustained various aches, pains and injuries from the constant stress that running places on the body,” says Cassel. “What makes swimming so beneficial and useful is that it can provide both a positive stress to the body to help it grow stronger and also provide an incredible tool for recovery from other activities.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cassel encourages her adult clients and athletes to swim in cold, open water whenever they get the chance, which she says helps decrease overall inflammation, boost the immune system and improve metabolic efficiency.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>“Water acts as a gravity barrier, so your body feels more weightless,” says swim instructor and lifeguard at&nbsp;<strong><a class=""gl-link"" href=""https://floridaswimcompany.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-di-id=""di-id-438767ee-ae4daa89"">Florida Swim Company</a></strong>&nbsp;Melissa Lasseter. “When you land from a jump on pavement, all of your weight is thrusted downward, which causes your legs and feet to hold much more weight than they normally do. Water acts as an aid, helping to decrease the amount of weight shifted to your legs/feet. In turn, this helps your muscles, bones and joints work with less pain.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<h2>BENEFIT #3: SWIMMING CHILLS YOU OUT.</h2>
<div>“Swimming keeps your mind focused on one action, instead of letting it wander,” says Lasseter. “Many people think swimming is peaceful because it helps to relax and&nbsp;<strong><a class=""gl-link"" href=""https://www.reebok.com/us/blog/566442-stressed-how-to-chill-fast"" data-di-id=""di-id-659eeb87-33b31d10"">decompress the mind</a></strong>.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>“This is something we discuss with our athletes often,” says Schwarz. “Our student-athletes have a challenging amount of schoolwork. Practice sessions are their opportunity to get away from whatever transpired that day, or whatever major work they have to do later. It’s a focused escape where they can dial-in on just being an athlete and challenge themselves physically. They tend to come out of the pool more focused and prepared for what’s in front of them.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<h2>BENEFIT #4: IT SLOWS AGING(!)</h2>
<div>“The obvious benefits to swimming are greater strength and cardio,” says Schwarz, “but I think a surprising benefit is that swimming can delay the effects of aging. Building muscle, increasing blood flow, reducing weight and lowering blood pressure have all been proven to slow the aging process.”&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>An&nbsp;<strong><a class=""gl-link"" href=""http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/4030.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-di-id=""di-id-6227f791-d0da0991"">Indiana University study</a></strong>&nbsp;calls swimming the “fountain of youth,” concluding that regular swimming can stall the aging process not just for years but decades. It’s clear that the benefits of swimming for both body and mind are abundant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<h2>BENEFIT #5: SWIMMING HELPS YOUR RECOVERY TIME.</h2>
<div>Unlike pounding the pavement while running, one benefit of swimming is that it’s gentler on your body, which helps lessen your recovery time. “You can string a few consecutive challenging workouts together without the worry about the stress on your knees and joints,” says Schwarz. “The recovery time from one workout to the next is much quicker than land activities.”</div>

The colors of your aura each have a specific shade and meaning assigned to them. “The colors of the aura can have very complex meanings because they are all different depending upon the location of the color for each individual,” says Leiding. “For example, when you get Red on your masculine side (right side of the body, picture left), it shows that you’re hard working and action oriented. If the Red appears on your feminine side (left side of the body, picture right), it could represent passion and a deep focused love.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Aura colors and what they represent:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>• Red (courage, passion, desire)</div>
<div>• Pink (love, sincerity, friendship)</div>
<div>• Magenta (individualist, free-spirited, stimulation)</div>
<div>• Orange (creativity, warmth, inspiring)</div>
<div>• Yellow (joyful, bright, cheerful)</div>
<div>• Green (patience, firmness, perseverance)</div>
<div>• Blue (devotion, trusting, empathetic)</div>
<div>• Turquoise (communicative, multi-tasker, truthful)</div>
<div>• Violet (magical, original, playful)</div>
<div>• White (spiritual, pure, honest)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can also impact how your aura colors come through by staying grounded and aware. “You can keep your aura in a naturally positive space by bringing awareness to your thoughts, emotions and ideas. Becoming more aware of your energy means that you can determine when a particular path is right for you.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<h2>UNDERSTANDING YOUR ENERGY</h2>
<div>We all have a kinetic power in each of us with the way our body moves. “Consciously caring for your aura is vital to your emotional and physical body. The more that you cleanse foreign energy from your space, the easier it is for you to be your true authentic self. This can help you in seeing which will help you make decisions easier, hear your body and mind clearly, and get you closer to your own information.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Some ways understanding your aura can help you:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>• Understand your energy field</div>
<div>• Identify any disturbances, leaks, holes or energy that’s not yours</div>
<div>• Learn to understand your mental make-up</div>
<div>• Assess your emotions and thoughts</div>
<div>• Gain deeper insight into your personality and inner self</div>
<div>• Know how strong you are by the vibrancy of your auric field</div>
<div>• Gauge your influence over others by the width of your aura field</div>
<div>• Reveal the inner secrets which may also be hidden to you</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Leiding says the more tapped into our aura we are, the more information you can bring into your body to process and move forward. “A healthy aura can act as a protective field for your personal space. When the aura is charged up and bright with vital energy, personal troubles tend to “slide” right off of it, leaving more room for you to create what you truly desire.” As we shift our energy and keep our auras charged, we can live our healthiest and most authentic lives. Stay energized and stay focused on what makes you feel good and the rest will follow. Need some inspiration? Create new energy with new kicks.</div>","2021-07-12 14:47:22","2021-07-12 14:57:32","2021-07-01 00:00:00",1,1,,magefan_blog/blog012.jpg,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>While your footwear can help you tap into your energy, learning about the&nbsp;<strong><a class=""gl-link"" href=""https://auragami.la/pages/color-interpretations"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-di-id=""di-id-f5803e1e-801c3991"">colors of your aura</a></strong>&nbsp;beyond just the colors of the rainbow you learned in school, can also prove useful.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Q: There’s a lot of talk out there about&nbsp;<a class=""gl-link"" href=""https://www.reebok.com/us/blog/643529-what-to-know-about-intermittent-fasting"" data-di-id=""di-id-5f827a5-fd695bc8"">intermittent fasting</a>. Is it ever okay to work out on an empty stomach?&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>A: “It depends on the type of workout,” says Integrative and Functional Medicine Nutritionist at&nbsp;<strong><a class=""gl-link"" href=""https://www.starkelnutrition.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-di-id=""di-id-5492ba3e-2a877260"">Starkel Nutrition</a></strong>&nbsp;Amanda Cirie. “Folks who are fasted and heading into a cardio session will burn more fat when exercising on empty, but burning more fat doesn't equate to getting leaner or stronger. With a properly fueled body, you can exercise harder, burn more calories and potentially burn more body fat for overall weight loss. For those about to do weight training or lifting, consuming a combination of protein and carbohydrates together before exercise will provide more energy to meet workout goals, build muscle tissue and help prevent tissue injuries.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>“In general, I don't recommend fasted workouts, especially prior to those lasting longer than 60 minutes,” says Registered Dietitian&nbsp;<strong><a class=""gl-link"" href=""https://laurenleedynutrition.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-di-id=""di-id-5492ba3e-16ca215"">Lauren Leedy</a></strong>. “We know that training in a fasted state is associated with decreased physical performance. To provide adequate fuel and prevent muscle breakdown, our bodies perform best with some sort of carbohydrate-based pre-workout fuel, even if it’s as simple as a banana or piece of toast. With that being said, if you experience gastrointestinal upset or the workout is lower in intensity, a fasted workout might be okay for you.”&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>“Eating a few calories before a workout depends on how hard you plan to work out,” says trainer&nbsp;<strong><a class=""gl-link"" href=""https://www.lalofitness.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-di-id=""di-id-e1e4f46e-8c5aeee7"">Lalo Fuentes</a></strong>. “If it’s light cardio right after waking up, it's okay to do it on an empty stomach. However, if you wake up and wait some time, it’s best to eat something light before your workout. When you’re doing a more challenging workout, you’ll benefit by eating something 45 minutes beforehand. I recommend protein smoothies, yogurt or a low-acidity fruit like peaches.”</div>","2021-07-12 14:48:33","2021-07-12 14:58:53","2021-07-01 00:00:00",1,1,,magefan_blog/blog033.jpg,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,"<div>You’ve got an hour before your&nbsp;<strong><a class=""gl-link"" href=""https://www.reebok.com/us/blog/647874-how-to-start-weight-training"" data-di-id=""di-id-9ad5472d-2ad030ae"">training session</a></strong>&nbsp;and you’re absolutely starving.

<div>When you need help breaking through these motivational barriers, sometimes all it takes is repeating the right phrase.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Fitness Pro: Christian Harris, Reebok athlete</strong></div>
<div><strong>Mantra:</strong>&nbsp;“Head down, mouth shut, work.”</div>
<div><strong>The story:</strong>&nbsp;Harris first heard his go-to mantra in 2013 at a training camp, and it immediately resonated with him. He finds it useful when he starts to feel distracted or if negative vibes creep into his workout. “It’s simple, but has a lot of meaning in fitness and in life,” he says. “Life can be distracting, but when it comes to training, I need to turn everything off: Head down, stop the mental talk, mouth shut, put my best effort forward, work.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Fitness Pro: Kristin Traskie, ACSM-certified personal trainer</strong></div>
<div><strong>Mantra:</strong>&nbsp;""I am capable. I am strong. I believe in myself.”</div>
<div><strong>The story:</strong>&nbsp;“I Am” statements allow Traskie to identify who she is and who she wants to be. “Especially during this past year, being a working mom, trying to provide family structure during a time of chaos, throwing in the never-ending pivots of remote working, remote school, stress of the unknown, mental health and trying to&nbsp;<a class=""gl-link"" href=""https://www.reebok.com/us/blog/664926-this-mom-reinvents-what-supermom-means"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-di-id=""di-id-9ad5472d-ec954fa2""><strong>keep it all together</strong></a>, my mantra was needed more than ever,” she adds. “It definitely helped motivate me and allowed me to express the power of my thoughts and intent.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sometimes, Traskie switches things up with other motivational “I Am” statements. “On days I am questioning myself or my confidence is shaken, it might simply come down to ‘I Am Enough,’” she says.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Fitness Pro: Chris Vitek, fitness specialist and wellness coach</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Mantra:</strong>&nbsp;“Movement is medicine.”</div>
<div><strong>The story:</strong>&nbsp;When the pandemic and stay-at-home orders hit, Vitek, a fitness specialist at Athletico Physical Therapy in Oak Brook, IL, began to look outside the gym for exercise—for himself and his clients. “Movement is medicine” became his mantra, he says, because it provided a reminder that exercise was more necessary than ever, given people’s increasingly sedentary lifestyle, and that&nbsp;<strong><a class=""gl-link"" href=""https://www.reebok.com/us/blog/617129-how-to-create-a-fitness-habit"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-di-id=""di-id-9ad5472d-396534cb"">fitness habits</a></strong>&nbsp;can be created “at any time and any moment.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Vitek advocates taking breaks to stretch, do yoga, walk or run during your workday—or getting in daily steps by walking your dog. “Or park in the farthest spot at the grocery store or opt to walk the golf course,” he suggests. The most important thing is to seize opportunities to move.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Fitness pro: Delmas Bolin, M.D., Ph.D., professor of sports and family medicine</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Mantra:</strong>&nbsp;“MOVE!”</div>
<div><strong>The story:</strong>&nbsp;“The keys to happiness are having someone to love, something to do and something to look forward to,” says Bolin, who teaches at the Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine in Blacksburg, VA, and serves as the head team physician/medical director for Radford University in Radford, VA. For him, “something to look forward to” usually involves running a 5 or 10K with his wife or taking a challenging hike. When preparing for these activities, “MOVE!” is his motivator. “Having a race or an event scheduled is key in motivating me to move,” he says.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The most effective mantras are “ones that have meaning only for you,” Bolin says. “I counsel people to find a phrase or philosophy that is theirs, and then&nbsp;<em>keep it to yourself</em>—just for you. It is yours alone and each time you reach success with it, use it to build on for the next challenge.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Fitness pro: Nicole Thompson, ACE-certified personal trainer</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Mantras:</strong>&nbsp;“I believe in you,” “You can do this” and “I can stop anytime.”</div>
<div><strong>The story:</strong>&nbsp;San Diego-based Thompson, who has a master’s degree in sport and performance psychology and is a long-distance runner, believes in the power of affirmative self-talk—in everyday life and while exercising. “Telling myself I believe in my abilities is not only encouraging but confidence-boosting as well,” she says. The message that she “can stop anytime” motivates her because “I know quitting is always an option, but I am choosing to push forward—proving to myself that while I can stop, I won’t, nor do I want to.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>She has found her go-to mantras to be especially useful during long, challenging runs. “Having a mantra pushes me through physical—and sometimes mental—walls,” she says. “I also repeat ‘You can do this’ or ‘I believe in you’ at the start line of a race to help get me energized, excited and confident.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To find a mantra that works for you, think about a phrase that you believe in. “It doesn’t need to be complicated,” Thompson says. “It’s a few inspirational words to tell yourself to help you keep going when you feel like quitting.” Bottom line: There’s no right or wrong here. Whatever helps you commit to your workout is great. Remember, you got this.</div>","2021-07-12 14:49:23","2021-07-12 14:54:55","2021-07-01 00:00:00",1,1,,magefan_blog/blog042.jpg,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,"<div>You’re in the gym or at the track, working out hard.

We’d expect the section from the second time check to the finish to be the most crucial for stage-win hopefuls.</p>
<p class=""body-text"">Time trials often reward a so-called “negative split” where the strategy is to try to ride faster in the second half of the course than the first. With fatigue setting in here, it’s here that riders who were disciplined with pacing will start to raise their average speed. They won’t have much to deal with weather-wise, but the forecast does call for moderate crosswinds out of the north. Because the course essentially doubles back on itself in the middle part, they’ll face crosswinds from both sides, but the final 5km will be mostly a tailwind.</p>
<h3 class=""body-h3"">Riders to Watch</h3>
<p class=""body-text"">This will be a fight between the specialists and two of the top GC riders. That’s for the stage win, at least. There are only a few possible position changes in the top 10, and likely none for the podium.</p>
<p class=""body-text"">As far as the GC goes: yellow jersey Tadej Pogačar (UAE-Emirates) won the opening TT on a flatter course on Stage 5, while Jumbo-Visma’s Jonas Vingegaard, in second overall, was third on the day. Pogačar has a commanding overall lead of almost six minutes; barring some unexpected disaster, even if he dials it back a bit (which we don’t expect), his lead will be safe.</p>
<p class=""body-text"">And while Vingegaard is only six seconds clear of Richard Carapaz (Ineos Grenadiers,) he’s a substantially better time triallist and put over a minute into Carapaz in Stage 5. For his purposes, Carapaz is comfortably ahead of fourth-place rider Ben O’Connor (Ag2r-Citroen), 2:27 behind. There could be a fight for fourth between O’Connor and Bora-Hansgrohe’s Wilco Kelderman, who is 32 seconds further back. They were pretty evenly matched on Stage 5. And Alexey Lutsenko (Astana) could possibly (just) overhaul Movistar’s Enric Mas for sixth place.</p>
<p class=""body-text"">Aside from Pogačar and Vingegaard as stage threats, this will be a day for the TT specialists. That means Stefan Küng (Groupama-FDJ), narrowly beaten by Pogačar on Stage 5; Deceuninck-Quick Step’s Kasper Asgreen; and Jumbo-Visma’s Wout van Aert. Look for good rides from EF Education-Nippo’s Magnus Cort and Stefan Bisseger and DQS’s Mattia Cattaneo. Ineos’s Richie Porte and Geraint Thomas could try to salvage stage wins from an uncharacteristically quiet Tour for the team, but the best threats to win are Pogačar, Küng, Asgreen, and van Aert.</p>
<h3 class=""body-h3"">When to Watch</h3>
<p class=""body-text"">In time trials, riders start in reverse order of the overall classification, with the yellow jersey going last. That spreads the action out considerably. The first rider off the line, Tim Declercq, will start a little after 7 a.m. Eastern, while Pogačar isn’t scheduled to get rolling until 11:19 a.m.</p>
<p class=""body-text"">Around 9 a.m., you’ll see a group of potential contenders starting with Asgreen; Cort, Küng, Thomas, and Porte all start in the next half hour; you’ll also catch the finish for American Brandon McNulty, a strong time triallist.</p>
<p class=""body-text"">Then there’s a break before the final quartet of likely winners starts with van Aert, 19th overall, at 10:43, followed by Cattaneo and then the top GC riders.

Made from Dri-FIT single-knit, plated jersey fabric (a combination of organic cotton, recycled polyester and spandex), it wicks sweat away from your skin helping to keep you comfortable and warm. A cropped body, loose fit, open neckline, raglan sleeves, flat-seam construction (to reduce chaffing) and a gusset that runs all the way from the body to the sleeve hem allow for a full and free range of movement. But it’s also fitted where needed, with a ribbed collar, waistband and cuffs maintaining a snug, efficient fit that won’t leave it flapping about and getting in your way. A fashionable bleach-splattered design and color options that include blue, pink and soft grey alongside the traditional black, means it also looks great.</p>

<p>The established Nike Pro apparel uses the Dri-FIT technology which wicks sweat away from the skin to the surface of the garment to help keep you dry and minimize irritation during tough workouts, and incorporates flat-seam construction to help reduce irritation caused by chaffing. For Spring 2012, the weight of the stretch jersey fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) has been increased to make it more robust allowing it to be worn as an outer layer as well as under team uniforms. The compression fit of the pants offers great support, with a secure elastic waistband and internal gusset for comfort. The range includes the 18.5 inch capris, funky 2.5-inch short print, bright and bold 5-inch short. These are complemented by the racer-style Nike Pro Bra, which offers freedom of movement while using its compression fit and nylon stabilizers in the bra straps to provide the level of support needed for a medium-impact training session that might involve running, and multidirectional movement.</p>

The Dri-FIT stretch-jersey fabric (polyester and spandex mix) hugs the body but also wicks sweat away from the skin keeping you cool, dry and comfortable. The positioning of the side seams keeps the top streamline and simple and the longer body not only elongates the look, but also keeps your rear covered when you Bend or Squat. Raglan sleeves allow arms and shoulders to move freely in moves such as the Pull while an underarm gusset and flat seam keep you comfortable. Tops come in an extensive range of block colors, with a subtle Nike swoosh on the breast. Attractive on its own, this slim-fit top is also great for layering with a jacket or team uniform.</p>

<p>The soft, cozy pre- and post-workout garment that will keep you comfortable during your warm up and cool down. Made from Dri-FIT single-knit, plated jersey fabric (a combination of organic cotton, recycled polyester and spandex), it wicks sweat away from your skin helping to keep you comfortable and warm. A cropped body, loose fit, open neckline, raglan sleeves, flat-seam construction (to reduce chaffing) and a gusset that runs all the way from the body to the sleeve hem allow for a full and free range of movement. But it’s also fitted where needed, with a ribbed collar, waistband and cuffs maintaining a snug, efficient fit that won’t leave it flapping about and getting in your way. A fashionable bleach-splattered design and color options that include blue, pink and soft grey alongside the traditional black, means it also looks great.</p>

At the back, the waistband is ribbed to keep it in place and tilted up for a natural fit helping to give you reassurance that you won’t be exposed when bending and stretching.

The lightweight fabric blend feels soft and luxurious but efficiently wicks sweat away from the skin during even a tough workout, helping to keep you dry and minimizing irritation. No seams also mean less chance of chaffing. A ribbed hem on the capris leg keeps it in place so you don’t have to worry about distractions as you power your legs through a demanding workout.</p>

<p>These eye-catching shorts consist of two layers, which work together for comfort, freedom of movement, and sweat management. The outer short is a Dri-FIT taffeta fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) that wicks sweat away to the surface of the short and dries quickly. This fabric also has a two-way stretch for an athletic fit and a side hem vent that keeps legs unrestricted when performing core moves such as the Lunge or Bend. The inner compression short and gusset is a soft Dri-FIT stretch-jersey fabric (polyester and spandex mix in a contrasting color) which wicks sweat away from the skin. Design features such as the elastic waistband and external drawcord ensure a snug, secure fit, lying flat on the body for a more flattering silhouette, while the flat seam construction reduces chaffing.</p>

<p>These eye-catching shorts consist of two layers, which work together for comfort, freedom of movement, and sweat management. The outer short is a Dri-FIT taffeta fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) that wicks sweat away to the surface of the short and dries quickly. This fabric also has a two-way stretch for an athletic fit and a side hem vent that keeps legs unrestricted when performing core moves such as the Lunge or Bend. The inner compression short and gusset is a soft Dri-FIT stretch-jersey fabric (polyester and spandex mix in a contrasting color) which wicks sweat away from the skin. Design features such as the elastic waistband and external drawcord ensure a snug, secure fit, lying flat on the body for a more flattering silhouette, while the flat seam construction reduces chaffing.</p>

<p>The established Nike Pro apparel uses the Dri-FIT technology which wicks sweat away from the skin to the surface of the garment to help keep you dry and minimize irritation during tough workouts, and incorporates flat-seam construction to help reduce irritation caused by chaffing. For Spring 2012, the weight of the stretch jersey fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) has been increased to make it more robust allowing it to be worn as an outer layer as well as under team uniforms. The compression fit of the pants offers great support, with a secure elastic waistband and internal gusset for comfort. The range includes the 18.5 inch capris, funky 2.5-inch short print, bright and bold 5-inch short. These are complemented by the racer-style Nike Pro Bra, which offers freedom of movement while using its compression fit and nylon stabilizers in the bra straps to provide the level of support needed for a medium-impact training session that might involve running, and multidirectional movement.</p>

<p>A flattering V-neck top that creates an elegant slimline silhouette. The Dri-FIT stretch-jersey fabric (polyester and spandex mix) hugs the body but also wicks sweat away from the skin keeping you cool, dry and comfortable. The positioning of the side seams keeps the top streamline and simple and the longer body not only elongates the look, but also keeps your rear covered when you Bend or Squat. Raglan sleeves allow arms and shoulders to move freely in moves such as the Pull while an underarm gusset and flat seam keep you comfortable. Tops come in an extensive range of block colors, with a subtle Nike swoosh on the breast. Attractive on its own, this slim-fit top is also great for layering with a jacket or team uniform.</p>

Made from Dri-FIT single-knit, plated jersey fabric (a combination of organic cotton, recycled polyester and spandex), it wicks sweat away from your skin helping to keep you comfortable and warm. A cropped body, loose fit, open neckline, raglan sleeves, flat-seam construction (to reduce chaffing) and a gusset that runs all the way from the body to the sleeve hem allow for a full and free range of movement. But it’s also fitted where needed, with a ribbed collar, waistband and cuffs maintaining a snug, efficient fit that won’t leave it flapping about and getting in your way. A fashionable bleach-splattered design and color options that include blue, pink and soft grey alongside the traditional black, means it also looks great.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""col--2of4 col--center col--center col--largest-device-3of4 col--large-device-3of4 col--small-device-full""&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""wrap--text""&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""text--p text--p--20 xtra--p""&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;Nike Seamless long bra&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""col--2of4 col--center col--center col--largest-device-3of4 col--large-device-3of4 col--small-device-full""&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""wrap--text""&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""text--p text--p--20 xtra--p""&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;A seamless skin that maximizes breathability and sweat management while minimizing chaffing, irritation or chunky straps that might impede movement.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""col--2of4 col--center col--center col--largest-device-3of4 col--large-device-3of4 col--small-device-full""&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""wrap--text""&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""text--p text--p--20 xtra--p""&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;It’s made from a lightweight fabric blend with a ribbed texture and hugs the contours of the body, flattering your shape.

In spite of its softness and lightness, it still offers support for a variety of low-impact gym activities with a hidden internal shelf bra. The longer length, sitting just below the hip, helps prevent the top from riding up, preserving your modesty and making you less self-conscious when performing squats and lunges or rotating.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""col--2of4 col--center col--center col--largest-device-3of4 col--large-device-3of4 col--small-device-full""&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""wrap--text""&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""text--p text--p--20 xtra--p""&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;Nike Go To Seamless Capris&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""col--2of4 col--center col--center col--largest-device-3of4 col--large-device-3of4 col--small-device-full""&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""wrap--text""&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""text--p text--p--20 xtra--p""&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;The tight, seamless fit helps support the muscles and flatters the figure. At the back, the waistband is ribbed to keep it in place and tilted up for a natural fit helping to give you reassurance that you won’t be exposed when bending and stretching. It also features a mesh panel for extra ventilation; this can also be used to help guide hip alignment, essential for exercises such as pilates. The lightweight fabric blend feels soft and luxurious but efficiently wicks sweat away from the skin during even a tough workout, helping to keep you dry and minimizing irritation. No seams also mean less chance of chaffing. A ribbed hem on the capris leg keeps it in place so you don’t have to worry about distractions as you power your legs through a demanding workout.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""col--2of4 col--center col--center col--largest-device-3of4 col--large-device-3of4 col--small-device-full""&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""wrap--text""&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""text--p text--p--20 xtra--p""&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;Nike Obsessed Capris&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""col--2of4 col--center col--center col--largest-device-3of4 col--large-device-3of4 col--small-device-full""&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""wrap--text""&gt;<br>&lt;div class=""text--p text--p--20 xtra--p""&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;A loose-fit option in Dri-FIT stretch French terry fabric (a cotton, nylon and spandex mix) for softness and comfort, suitable for a variety of training activities, particularly where you need to move freely.

For Spring 2012, the weight of the stretch jersey fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) has been increased to make it more robust allowing it to be worn as an outer layer as well as under team uniforms. The compression fit of the pants offers great support, with a secure elastic waistband and internal gusset for comfort.

It gives me an excuse to repost this gif starring my hockey mask and chainsaw earrings. (The gif was created by the fine folks at Spring, the Instagram-like shopping app.) The combination of a hockey mask and a chainsaw has come to be a recognizable reference to movie serial killers, even though it muddles together two different horror flicks. As I wrote in 2014 when I introduced the earrings, the character of Jason Voorhees in the Friday the 13th movies wore a hockey mask but wielded a machete. The chainsaw belongs to Leatherface of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series. Leatherface does wear masks, but his are made of human skin. But the Jason/Leatherface blend of killer accessories dates back at least to 1993, when The Simpsons used it in its “Cape Feare” episode. You can see how the earrings look on here. If you’re not into slasher movies, I’ve got skull jewelry (for every budget) that’s appropriate for Halloween and the rest of the year too. I certainly wear it all year round! I’m putting a few pieces on sale for the holiday. Check them out now, because these prices will be available for a limited time.

98,"What’s Irreplaceable",,,,whats-irreplaceable,,,,,,"<p>The reports of the armed robbery of Kim Kardashian in Paris — with millions of dollars of jewelry stolen — reminded me of advice my late business partner used to give to customers. Always insure your jewelry, she would tell people who were nervous about getting a sizable diamond. If (“God forbid!” she’d exclaim) you’re threatened with physical harm, give up the jewelry without hesitation. Keep yourself safe. File a police report. Then, she’d say, if the jewelry can’t be recovered, “We’ll use the insurance money to make you a bigger and better ring.” Kim might be an exception when it comes to that last step — at least when it comes to engagement-ring diamonds — it’s difficult to go bigger than Kim’s 20-carat Lorraine Schwartz ring and still have the use of one’s hand. Embed from Getty Images However, she could go from a skinny band to something more substantial. But that’s not important right now! No one — including Kim — should spend too much time mourning for jewelry. I admit that it can be hard to let go because jewelry is an unusually meaningful possession. (That’s what I like about it.) It’s often purchased to mark a special occasion: a graduation, an engagement, a marriage, the addition of a child to your family. It gets passed down from generation to generation. You expect that your good pieces will go to someone important to you, and be important to them too. Like diamond connoisseur Elizabeth Taylor said to — guess who? — Kim Kardashian in 2011, “Size does matter, but so does the size of the emotion behind it.” Elizabeth had big diamonds and big emotions in her life. The fifth and sixth of her eight husbands — actor Richard Burton (the passionate couple divorced, remarried, and divorced again) — bought her a 69.42-carat pear-shaped diamond that she wore in a necklace to the Oscars in 1970.</p>","2021-08-23 17:58:09","2021-08-23 17:58:09","2021-08-09 00:00:00",1,1,,magefan_blog/blog24.jpg,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>The reports of the armed robbery of Kim Kardashian in Paris — with millions of dollars of jewelry stolen — reminded me of advice my late business partner used to give to customers.

There were critics and admirers, but after remaining relevant for over a decade, it’s clear that the critics have had no influence on the popularity of oversized shades. Although their popularity has remained constant, one thing has surely not: their size. Oversized sunnies have only become more oversized throughout the years. The Dior SoLight collection is proof of that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first pair of sunglasses in the collection, the Dior SoLight1, take the wide frame, large lens look took an extreme. And, all we have to say is that we are all for pushing limits. These trendy shades have a unique mask effect, therefore, if you need a big pair of shades to protect you from the sun, cover your face after one too many long nights, or both, the SoLight1 are calling your name. These sunglasses are super lightweight and have lenses that offer 100% UVA/UVB protection. Thankfully, we carry them in not one, but three colors: black frames with dark gray lenses,ivory frames with nude lenses and light pink frame&nbsp;with light pink lenses to match.</p>

<p>The Dior SoLight2 sunglasses are a rectangular take on the oversized frame style. These chunky sunnies have an ultra-thin, curved frame, which makes them large and in charge, yet super light. Their monochromatic lenses also offer 100% UVA/UVB protection, so they are just as trendy and shielding as their SoLight1 counterpart. They come in four different colors: light pink frames with matching lenses, dark blue frames with matching lenses, black frames with shaded grey lenses&nbsp; and brown frames with shaded brown lenses.&nbsp;</p>

Today I'm sharing 7 ways to enhance your own natural beauty and embrace being a better version of yourself, including some of my own personal top tips that help me do just that. So if you're interested in a natural, fresh-faced look, keep on reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;C O M P L I M E N T R A T H E R T H A N C O N T R A S T&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;Enhance what you have by choosing colours close to your natural hues. Take mental note of the colour your cheeks turn after a brisk walk and find a similar tone in your blush. I find rosy pinks in general that give a soft sheen are pretty universally flattering - I particularly love the Marc Jacobs Air Blush in Flesh &amp;amp; Fantasy as it's so soft and blendable on the skin. Liquid blushes like Daniel Sandler's Watercolour blush, or cream formulas generally look incredibly natural too - my favourites are the Chanel Healthy Glow blush stick in 02 and Stila's Convertible Colour in Peony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;T R E A T Y O U R H A I R&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;Just a fresh trim can add such life to your locks, which in turn lifts your whole aesthetic. I like to go for a fairly blunt cut so that my ends look nice and weighty (or as much is possible for fine hair like mine!). For my hair, no amount of conditioning is too much, so I like to apply hair masks and treatments as often as possible. I've used the Macadamia Deep Repair Masque for years and it remains a firm favourite - even if only for the smell! A divine, sweet, fruity scent and it's slightly oily texture makes my hair feel delicious and soft. I can't wait to get my hands on the Edward Bess Hair Hero too - it's supposed to make your hair smooth, strong and glossy, and if it helps me get anywhere close to his locks then I'm in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;E A T V I T A M I N - R I C H F O O D S&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;We all know that beauty starts from within so I won't linger too long. Eat lots of colourful fruit and veg, leafy greens, healthy fats, drink lots of water and don't go cutting out major food groups - a balanced, nutrient-dense diet is failsafe. I do love a good dessert though, and my Healthy Raspberry &amp;amp; Rose Cupcakes are a great way to satisfy your sweet tooth whilst getting your fibre and healthy fats - so tasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;A S E A M L E S S B A S E&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;I think base is my favourite part of makeup and I think I've become pretty good at getting things looking light, natural and seamless through all the practice! In my mind, achieving this is down to both product and application in equal parts. My favourite foundations are the Hera UV Mist (I love this one), the Etude House Real Powder cushion, Charlotte Tilbury Magic Foundation, and my new love, the Hourglass Vanish stick foundation - I think a velvet finish looks most skin-like and undetectable. I only apply foundation sparingly where I need it - across the tops of my cheeks, my chin and a little between my brows and nose just to even out redness - and blend thoroughly with an airpuff, it's absolutely the best way to apply for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;My top tip for natural skin is to apply just enough foundation so that you'd be happy to go out if you were to stop there - if my face looks flat, mask-like, or it looks like I desperately need blush, lip or eye makeup to bring the look together then I've gone too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;L O W K E Y M A K E U P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;Yes less is more but enhancing natural beauty doesn't mean no makeup altogether. Rather than do liner, try tightlining your upper waterline with a dark gel liner - my hands down favourite is the Barry M Bold Waterproof liner - it's smudge and waterproof and deep inky black. I like to take a little more on a flat brush and wiggle it into my lashline, just to add the definition I want and make my lashes look a bit thicker - they need all the help they can get!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;For lips, I love a soft Bobbi Brown neutral like Italian Rose, but have grativated to oils lately - they feel so great on the lips too. Something like the YSL Volupte Tint In Oil or Clarins Lip Comfort Oil are perfect picks. Rather than sitting on the lips, they sink in for that pillow-lip plumpness I love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;T R Y C R E A M Y T E X T U R E S&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;I just cannot resist a subtle cream highlight. Something with super fine shimmer and a voluminous texture that picks up the light when you turn your head - divine. Kevyn Aucoin's Candlelight cream has been a long time favourite, it's definitely one of the best. Two newer additions, that have quickly become firm favourites for me, are the Burberry Nude Radiance and Rosie For Autograph's cream highlight, which features in her gorgeous palette - reviewed here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;A top trick that I love to do is to apply some of the REN Beauty Shot along my cheekbones instead of highlighter - it's plump and slightly glossy and is the most beautiful, natural highlight ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;D O O N E T H I N G F O R Y O U R S E L F E V E R Y D A Y&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;Inner confidence and happiness shows on the outside, fact, so feeding your ego with positive affirmations can do wonders. Treat yourself to little pleasures every single day - cook yourself a nutritious and tasty breakfast, or read some inspiring quotes, run a bath, write down something that made you happy, do something crafty, give yourself a manicure, or bake yourself a cake and splurge on frivolous cake decorations. Whatever it is, make sure to treat your soul everyday with something little, and you'll soon see and feel the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</div>","2022-02-24 16:05:39","2022-02-24 16:05:39","2022-02-24 16:05:39",1,1,,magefan_blog/blog013.jpg,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,"<div data-content-type=""html"" data-appearance=""default"" data-element=""main"">Whether you’re a beauty newbie or you’ve been into all things makeup and hair for years, there’s always something new you can learn.

Rather than do liner, try tightlining your upper waterline with a dark gel liner - my hands down favourite is the Barry M Bold Waterproof liner - it's smudge and waterproof and deep inky black. I like to take a little more on a flat brush and wiggle it into my lashline, just to add the definition I want and make my lashes look a bit thicker - they need all the help they can get!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;For lips, I love a soft Bobbi Brown neutral like Italian Rose, but have grativated to oils lately - they feel so great on the lips too. Something like the YSL Volupte Tint In Oil or Clarins Lip Comfort Oil are perfect picks. Rather than sitting on the lips, they sink in for that pillow-lip plumpness I love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;I just cannot resist a subtle cream highlight. Something with super fine shimmer and a voluminous texture that picks up the light when you turn your head - divine. Kevyn Aucoin's Candlelight cream has been a long time favourite, it's definitely one of the best. Two newer additions, that have quickly become firm favourites for me, are the Burberry Nude Radiance and Rosie For Autograph's cream highlight, which features in her gorgeous palette - reviewed here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;A top trick that I love to do is to apply some of the REN Beauty Shot along my cheekbones instead of highlighter - it's plump and slightly glossy and is the most beautiful, natural highlight ever.&lt;/p&gt;

Today I'm sharing 7 ways to enhance your own natural beauty and embrace being a better version of yourself, including some of my own personal top tips that help me do just that. So if you're interested in a natural, fresh-faced look, keep on reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;C O M P L I M E N T R A T H E R T H A N C O N T R A S T&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;Enhance what you have by choosing colours close to your natural hues. Take mental note of the colour your cheeks turn after a brisk walk and find a similar tone in your blush. I find rosy pinks in general that give a soft sheen are pretty universally flattering - I particularly love the Marc Jacobs Air Blush in Flesh &amp;amp; Fantasy as it's so soft and blendable on the skin. Liquid blushes like Daniel Sandler's Watercolour blush, or cream formulas generally look incredibly natural too - my favourites are the Chanel Healthy Glow blush stick in 02 and Stila's Convertible Colour in Peony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;T R E A T Y O U R H A I R&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;Just a fresh trim can add such life to your locks, which in turn lifts your whole aesthetic. I like to go for a fairly blunt cut so that my ends look nice and weighty (or as much is possible for fine hair like mine!). For my hair, no amount of conditioning is too much, so I like to apply hair masks and treatments as often as possible. I've used the Macadamia Deep Repair Masque for years and it remains a firm favourite - even if only for the smell! A divine, sweet, fruity scent and it's slightly oily texture makes my hair feel delicious and soft. I can't wait to get my hands on the Edward Bess Hair Hero too - it's supposed to make your hair smooth, strong and glossy, and if it helps me get anywhere close to his locks then I'm in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;E A T V I T A M I N - R I C H F O O D S&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;We all know that beauty starts from within so I won't linger too long. Eat lots of colourful fruit and veg, leafy greens, healthy fats, drink lots of water and don't go cutting out major food groups - a balanced, nutrient-dense diet is failsafe. I do love a good dessert though, and my Healthy Raspberry &amp;amp; Rose Cupcakes are a great way to satisfy your sweet tooth whilst getting your fibre and healthy fats - so tasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;A S E A M L E S S B A S E&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;I think base is my favourite part of makeup and I think I've become pretty good at getting things looking light, natural and seamless through all the practice! In my mind, achieving this is down to both product and application in equal parts. My favourite foundations are the Hera UV Mist (I love this one), the Etude House Real Powder cushion, Charlotte Tilbury Magic Foundation, and my new love, the Hourglass Vanish stick foundation - I think a velvet finish looks most skin-like and undetectable. I only apply foundation sparingly where I need it - across the tops of my cheeks, my chin and a little between my brows and nose just to even out redness - and blend thoroughly with an airpuff, it's absolutely the best way to apply for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;My top tip for natural skin is to apply just enough foundation so that you'd be happy to go out if you were to stop there - if my face looks flat, mask-like, or it looks like I desperately need blush, lip or eye makeup to bring the look together then I've gone too far.&lt;/p&gt;
